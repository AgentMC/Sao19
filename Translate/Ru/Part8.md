# Part 8

<!--<sup><a href="#Prim1">1</a></sup>-->

There were only five of them at the dinner: Исукан, Шейта, Кирито, Лизетта and Ронье, but it was warm, lively and as enjoyable as a dinner in latter’s family house in Northern Centoria.

It seemed that Исукан in half-mischievous mind arranged many dubious delicacies such as "Broth lizard on skewers" or "Spark mushroom wrapped in fried bean curd", which Кирито energetically and courageously challenged getting as the result bizarre high voice, so Лизетта laughed “**kya-kya**” each time he spoke afterwards. Looking at their loved daughter, Шейта and Исукан also happily smiled.

After finishing the meal that brought her to the feeling of “_a baby, a family, it is all good_”, and bathing the second time today, Ронье returned to the room they were given.

The bathroom was truly small compared to the public baths of Центральный Собор, but considering that this is roughly the top floor of a gigantic castle with a height of 500 mel, fresh hot water available throughout the day seemed to be a miracle. As they did not use sacred art like in Собор, she wondered how the massive amounts of hot water were transferred, but turned out when it was just a rocky mountain in a very beginning, hot water gushed from near the top and the water canals were still used for cooking, bathing and heating even after the mountain became a castle.

Compared to last night's cheap hotel, the room was warm, the bed was soft, and sleepy Ронье changed to prepared sleepwear before hearing the 9 o'clock bell. _I will be coming home to Мира Людей early tomorrow morning so it's better to go to bed early, although somehow it is regrettable that the day is going to an end,_ she though while lying down and staring at the northern wall.

_Beyond the wall, Кирито is also preparing to sleep soon. Or had he gone to bed already? We were talking to each other for over forty hours since departing from the central capital but I feel that I still haven’t told him anything important yet.  
Of course, what is the most important is the escort mission, I offered to accompany him not to chat, nevertheless ──_ and Ронье felt the strong urge to get up from the bed and knock the next room door.

But Кирито had a loved person, and the name of her was Асуна. They were both people from real world, she was as beautiful as goddess Stacia, friendly without discrimination to anyone, stronger than anyone if we’re talking swords. At the time of a Foreign World War, Ронье could only tremble in a horse-drawn carriage, but Асуна, even terribly injured, protected Кирито with her blood and sweat. There was no way she could possibly compete with such a person.

_Do not let those feelings reach your mouth. No way._

Ронье wrapped her head in a thick blanket and strongly closed the eyes. However, the drowsiness that had left was hardly coming back.

***

Ронье who finally fell asleep, and due to tiredness of a long journey had even forgot to turn off the ore lantern, was awaked by the feeling that she heard a faint cry.

Outside of the window was still dark night. It was about 2 o'clock or 3 o'clock by her sensations. She listened carefully while lying on the bed, then closed the eyelids again thinking that it was a dream. But then, this time certainly, a dismayed voice came from behind the door. And multiple busy footsteps sounded.

Remaining in a nightwear, she got up to the floor and pushed an ear against the door. When the footsteps which seemed to be from guards quickly moved in towards the stairway and she slowly opened the door, Кирито’s face shown from the next room.

Still half asleep, the Премьер-Мечник approached her in small steps.

"сенпай ... what happened?"

"Don’t know... but it seems all the guards have gone to the lower floor..."

Кирито seemed to have finally awakened after blinking several times, and said while covering Ронье’s shoulders with the cloak he wore.

"Let’s go as well."

"Er...eeeer? .... Is it okay?"

"We might be able to help with something."

He lightly tapped her shoulder, so Ронье could only nod.

"But if you continue standing in the doorway, I will have to go back!"

Ронье rushed behind Кирито who began running immediately and followed him.

They ran down the stairs and arrived on the 48th floor, and at the same time, a scream could be clearly heard.

That voice crying "Down there!" definitely belonged to Исукан. They nodded each other and ran through a wide corridor.

On the right side at the end of the corridor, they saw a large two-sash door in front. The obsidian door decorated with silver, clearly guarding a considerably important area, was opened wide, and the voice of the guards filled with fear and hatred were constantly heard from the inside.

Кирито and Ронье quickly passed through a corridor of about 20 meters and jumped into the room.

Immediately, innumerable bright lights glowing on both sides dazzled the eyes. In light of ore lanterns, the guards of about ten people were standing in the passage, and ahead of them, was a large room filled with a myriad of decorated weapons and armor, all sorts of jewelry and ornaments. It must be an armor store of Obsidia castle, or a treasury.

"It's monsters......!"

From the other side of the guards, the voice of Исукан resounded again. Кирито who had stopped the movement, jumped over the guards and disappeared behind them. Ронье also agreed, and having checked that the cloak covers her pajamas, she made a short run-up and kicked off the floor.

Aincrad sword style followed by Кирито and Асуна emphasized the importance of running and jumping besides the characteristic continuous sword skill, and Ронье practiced every day. Thanks to that effort she succeeded in jumping over a group of guards and could hear men's surprised voices behind, but didn’t pay attention to that.

A few mels ahead, there were Исукан and Шейта in night dressing. And beyond them, there were two black things.

They could only be named monsters. Although the shape in the whole was close to a humans or sub-humans, the neck and arms were profusely long, and in front of a head like of some sort of fish, was a round restlessly shrinking mouth in which countless fangs grew inward. Four eyes were placed on all sides of the conical head, the wings with a thin membrane flapped on the back and the long tail loosely fell from the waist.

"Is that....... minions!?"

When Кирито screamed, Шейта and Исукан glanced back.

"Ah, have you woken up? However, we cannot involve visitors in our internal problems! Such a monster, I will beat up with one hit!"

A fire-like glow wrapped Исукан’s clenched fist. But Шейта standing next to him quickly drew the right hand to stop her husband.

"The blood of minions is a poison. Unarmed man cannot attack."

"Even if so, I......."

As Исукан groaned, two minions, as if they understood the talk of two people, spew out the air with sound “**fshaaa, fshaaa**”.

This was the first time to see with her own eyes, but Ронье had some knowledge about minions. They were artificial creatures used by Тёмной Территории dark arts masters thrown in large quantity into the early stage of the “Battle by the Great Eastern Gate” of the Foreign World War, successfully annihilated by the use of complete armament control of the sacred treasure "Time Piercing Sword" of the knight commander Bercouli. So, human forces soldiers did not suffer any damage at all, just saw the glimpse of slightly oversized bats, but the real thing was far more frightening than that. The length of the body was nearly 2 mel, and the claws blackening at the ends of the long arms were long and sharp like knifes.

Moreover, it had strong resistance to a sacred art of any attribute, as well as puncturing and crushing damage, and it seemed that the most effective would be to slash with a sharp blade, but Шейта did not have a sword, of course. Ронье and Кирито, regretting to not have brought the sword from the room, both were unarmed.

"Honorable commander, leave it to us!"

One of the guards shouted from the back, but Исукан stubbornly did not move.

Same for minions, apparently, they only received instructions from those who controlled them not to attack but just give out threatening sounds. On both sides of monsters, several shelves collapsed, jewels and accessories were scattered on the floor, but it did not try to steal it.

And Ронье finally noticed that in the first place those two had been able to invade the treasury close to the top floor without being noticed by many guards.... There are huge wings on their back so they did not have to climb up the stairs. They flew in the dark of the night and invaded through the window. Taking a closer look, one could see that windows behind minions were destroyed and only metal frames left.

_And all these factors, that means...... that means ──_

When she thought of it something similar to a sharp spark blasted in the center of Ронье's head, an that moment Кирито sharply inhaled air.

"You two, avoid!"

The same time he shouted, he stuck the right hand out. A sparkling bright light spread around the palm, generating as much as thirty instances of cryogenic element at once.

Шейта and Исукан who saw it quickly jumped aside. Suddenly Кирито released cryogenic elements and burst them all around two minions. Normally, cryogenic element just diffuses its power in a wide range, but since it was controlled by an advanced technique, cold air clung to minions, and black giants were frozen white.

"**Gshaaaaa**!!"

Minions, shouting their round mouths on conical heads froze immediately and stopped moving. It was terrible freezing power, but minions made from clay had strong resistance to fire and ice. Even if it freezes for a moment, the life is not supposed to be reduced much ──

But, of course, Кирито was thinking about it. Keeping his right hand sticking out, he continued giving instructions.

"You two, now!"

"**Yshaaaa**!!"

Исукан shouted and kicked off the floor. Шейта also followed him.

"**Ura-ra-ra-a-a!**"

Исукан's fist wrapped with incarnation punched the trunk of the minion on the right. Immediately afterwards, the Шейта’s hand vertically sliced the minion on the left.

In a moment, the minion on the right exploded into countless fragments, the left minion was split into two and fell to the left and right. Both were completely frozen, so not a drop of a toxic blood spilled.

The guards cheered behind, and amazed Исукан turned around and said with a smile of admiration.

"You are amazing beyond those rumors, Кирито. I was told, even high-ranked clerics can generate only five elements with one hand, one per finger..."

"The story will be later, Исукан!"

Voice of Кирито, who cut the praise short, was feeling more tense than when he instructed the couple to attack.

"Minions, despite possibly taking some treasure here, did not try to attack us. The purpose of the dark arts master who released them is surely a diversion to hold us off!"

The moment she heard it, the dim guess Ронье got turned into a specific fear, and at the same time Шейта quickly paled.

"No way......"

She muttered so with a faint voice and started to run fiery. Like a wind she rushed between Ронье and Кирито, through the guards, and jumped out of the treasury.

"We too!"

Кирито shouted pulling Исукан’s pajamas of Мира Людей Eastern Empire style and began running.

"Wha…, what is goi…, going on?"

Кирито blushed and shouted to a fist fighter who leaked bewildered voice while kicking a polished obsidian floor barefoot.

"Perhaps, the real purpose of the arts master is much more important than treasure"

"More impor..."

Исукан repeating after him suddenly opened the eyes wide. Ронье felt that she heard the sound of red golden hair standing upright.

"Лизетта"

Immediately after he murmured the name of the baby in a low voice, both feet of fist fighter radiated a light-red glow.

**Gaan**! And the obsidian floor where he kicked off cracked like a spider's web. Rushing up skipping four or five steps he quickly separated from them by enormous accelerating and reached the top of the stairs few seconds after dashing ahead Шейта. Just behind him, Кирито glided in an ashihakobi<sup><a href="#Prim1">1</a></sup> style.

Resisting the shiver that tried to make the whole body numb, Ронье ran hard after them. She climbed the stairs and jumped into the corridor of the 49th floor, but there was already no appearance of the three, only footsteps can be heard.

Following the sound, she ran further and passed the child room first, then to the room behind it which probably was couple's bedroom.

When she rushed into the open door, an unusual odor struck her nose.

The light of one small ore lantern dimly lit the wide room, but still she clearly saw a big window shattered into pieces, the pool of pitch-black blood that spread before it and the two fallen guards.

Probably the guards touched the blood pool smelling of minions. Both of them seem to still have a breath, is it wasn’t clear whether they were panting because of an injury or was it an action of poison. Apart from the guards, there was only Исукан in the room.

"Guido, Gaiol, what happened!"

A guard held a hand trying to hold off screaming Исукан from approaching.

"Commander, don’t touch this......"

Another one reported with more a chagrin on his face, than pain.

"After the two of us went down for a while, when the window cracked...... when we entered, was a black monster…. We managed to fight it off, but unexpectedly a dark arts master appeared in the room, and he used dark art to make Guido and myself dizzy......."

Then, as the second guard began breathlessly panting, the first one continued the story.

"We got poisoned by the monster, and couldn’t move anymore. The arts master took Лизетта from the bed, and rode the monster out the window...... I saw it with my own eyes..."

"………… I… see……"

Исукан nodded to their words creaking his teeth.

At the right side of the room, there was a bed for two people at the wall and a small baby bed behind it. Most likely Лизетта spent the day in bright sunshine of the kids’ room and in the night she slept with her parents.

Cute little baby, only three months old, was kidnapped. Unsure how to act in those terrible circumstances, Ронье was just standing still, when Шейта and Кирито came into the room from the terrace behind the destroyed window.

"...... I couldn’t find them."

Шейта said this loudly, and Кирито gently shook his head.

"I could not perceive them either......."

Still in a bad mood, he glanced at the two guards laing down on the floor. He raised the right hand and generated elements just like previously in the treasury. But this time it was not cryogenic but white sparkling luminous elements. There were about a dozen, they divided further into and flew to the guards’ bodies.

A warm glow wrapped the two of them, and most of the black liquid that had accumulated on the floor disappeared as if it was evaporated by the light. The guards strangely shook their bodies and took a deep breath, then abruptly stood up and drew their heads down towards Шейта and Исукан.

"Commander, authorized ambassador, we could not fulfill our responsibilities and there’s no excuse for this!"

"As long as they kidnapped Лизетта whom we should have protected at all costs, with our lives we..."

Исукан in response to these words strongly shook the guards' shoulders.

"This won’t return Лизетта. Better lend me your strength to regain my daughter."

Even though his heart was probably shattered, the fist fighter said so with suppressed voice, and two of them stood straight again.

"First of all, we need to hear, what was the appearance of dark arts master that has broken in here. Have you saw that person's face? Heard his voice?"

"Well…"

The first to answer was a tall guard who would be named Guido.

"A deep black draped hood covered his face, it was invisible....... The voice was either of a man or of a woman, wasn’t clear..."

"I see……"

When Исукан bit his lips, Кирито opened his mouth instead.

"How long did it pass since the arts master fled outside the window and until we entered the room?"

The question was answered by a wide Gaiol.

"Three...... no, at best it was two minutes......"

"Two minutes...?"

Кирито with a doubtful face turned his eyes towards the night sky outside the window. Шейта also knitted eyebrows, muttering.

"He got on a wounded minion and disappeared in just two minutes...?"

_According to lectures by librarians of the large library, minions' flight speed is about the same as people run. We are at a height of 500 mils, it seems impossible to completely disappear in just two minutes in any direction, but if the opponent is a highly-ranked dark arts master, a hiding technique or something alike may be used._ However, if Кирито and Шейта weren’t able to find them, Ронье wouldn’t be either.

Being helpless, Ронье crossed the floor and approached the baby’s bed.

The bed shaped like a box was, of course, empty, except for pretty pacifiers and stuffed bear and dragon toys left behind; she was suddenly attacked by a feeling that her heart is being torn apart.

She deflected her eyes, and that moment.

Noticing that something strange fell on the stuffed dragon's figure, Ронье reached out her hand.

It was a parchment rounded and fastened with a red string. Anyway you look, it was not a baby's toy.

"Here...... In bed, there is......."

While saying that, she wanted to pick the parchment, but the one who did it was Исукан moving at the speed of a lightning bolt.

He easily cut a string that looked quite strong with fingertips and spread it. The left eye of Исукан opened wide, then he let a crooked groan from his throat, staggered and crushed on the bed.

From his hand, Шейта took the parchment next. The expression of astonishment also spread over the face of the knight, and after gently biting her lips, she handed it over to Кирито.

Standing beside Кирито who received the message, Ронье ran her eyes over the black characters.

【By the sunset of the 21st day of the 2nd month, publicly execute the Премьер-Мечник of the Объединённого Совета Мира Людей at the Great Stadium due to the attempted assassination of the Dark Army General Commander, and send back the head to Мира Людей. When that is not done, the head of the innocent baby will be delivered to Obsidia castle】

"............ Tha-t-t is............"

Leaking such words, Ронье shook her head several times. Today is the 21st day, just like it said. There was only about 13 or 14 more hours until the sunset which was set as the execution time limit.

At first, she thought that Исукан and Шейта could not do such a thing.

But quickly she understood that it was the life of the daughter of the two that was the price. Was there anything more important for the couple at that time?

Ронье’s left hand slowly moved and touched the left hip. But there was no sword. It remained in the bedroom, just like Кирито’s one.

Besides, even if they had swords...... If there’s a chance that Исукан obeys the threatening of the kidnappers, then what, fight with those two? And if Кирито and Ронье escape, Лизетта will die.

_I definitely do not want to forsake that innocent baby. However, it cannot excuse me from fulfilling my role of Кирито’s escort. No way._

Ронье stood, caught in a conflict tearing her apart that she could never imagine before. She tried to see the face of Кирито still holding the parchment, but couldn’t even move her neck.

"That...... Your Excellency..."

One of the guards standing side by side with his colleague by the wall said this in a faint voice. They surely wondered about the content of parchment, but Исукан lifted his gaze and pointed to the door with his right hand.

"Guido, Gaiol, go out in the hall, do not let anyone inside."

"Yes…"

Saluting the Тёмной Территории army commander, two guards headed to the door. However, Gaiol stopped his legs and turned around.

"There’s… one more thing......"

When four people gazed him quickly, the guard kept shrinking his short neck more and more.

"It's not a big deal... but as soon as the dark arts master and the monster left through the window, I felt like I heard some strange sound."

"Sound... what kind of sound?"

To Шейта's question, Gaiol answered after opening and closing the mouth several times as if searching for words.

"It’s like a turning of stone mill drums, kind of “**gorigori**”..."

"Stone mill drums...?"

It seemed that even Исукан familiar with this castle could find nothing to think about. Gaiol saluted again and closed the door behind himself.

In the bedroom filled with a heavy silence, the voice of Кирито sounded soon.

"....... I’m so sorry, Исукан, Шейта-сан. It is my responsibility that Лизетта was kidnapped..."

"...What are you talking about, do not blame yourself?"

He was in such a condition that even standing up was hard, and Исукан set down on the bed again, but still denied Кирито’s words.

"The problem is, in addition to dizzy guards of Lisa, it's me who has been dazzled. Th demon... minion of the dark arts master is supposed to be unable to fly until this height, or at least so I thought. Only the dragons of the Dark Knights Order can fly to this point, but they are prohibited from coming anywhere other than the departure and arrival platform at the back of the castle. So, I was convinced that there were no dangers coming in through the window..."

Both hands firmly gripped knees, and creaking added to the groaning. Шейта came to her husband and placed her slender hand on his.

"But after all, I guess I provoked this situation."

Кирито said again with a threatening letter in his right hand.

"Ронье realized the possibility that the murder in Мира Людей is a trap for make me go to Obsidia. But I decided that if I move to Obsidia in a day, no conspiracy could catch up with me. However, the guys who kidnapped Лизетта are good ones... they have a group in both Мира Людей and Тёмной Территории and they have a means to contact each other faster than with machine dragon."

"Machine... dragon? You used it to be able to move from Centoria to Obsidia in a day?<sup><a href="#Prim2">2</a></sup>"

Кирито nodded to Шейта’s question.

"Yes...... I will show it to you properly later. But now it's about Лизетта..."

He turned his eyes to parchment and continued with a lower voice.

"......Their goal is probably to make Мира Людей and Тёмной Территории hostile again, and if you ignore, they will surely carry out their threat. I will do my best to find Лизетта from now on, but...... if I fail to return her, I should be......."

"Shut up!!"

Исукан sharply cut Кирито’s words when he was going to say “executed”.

Ронье was aware that Кирито and Асуна moved from the real world to Underworld.

_They are lying in something called "estiel" that exists in the real world, and they said that only the soul is moved to Underworld. Therefore, even if the whole life is lost in Underworld, the two will not die. It is expected that the soul returns to the real world and they wake up there.  
Now Кирито is thinking about that. However, once they come back to the real world, they probably won’t be able to return to Underworld anymore —_ and they both said that. For Ронье it was synonymous with Кирито’s death. Of course, same went for all the people who have met Кирито and spent some time together. _…Мира Людей... No, the entire Underworld still needs him._

She could not put all the fears and thoughts swirling like a storm into words, but Ронье just came closer to Кирито and firmly grasped the hem of the black shirt.

Шейта, who noticed the gesture, relaxed her mouth a little. She nodded to Ронье as if she could feel slightly relieved and said in a low voice.

"First, I will go to the dark arts masters’ guild headquarters in the northern district to get the information. First of all, the who broke into this room is surely a stray master who does not belong to the current guild, but if minion was improved, I might be able to trace from that fact."

"I understood... that, I will go with you. If Шейта is alone there, the arts masters may try to mislead."

Исукан abruptly stood up and lifted the silver ring from the table by the bed and put it on the forehead. Шейта also began to change from her pajamas so Ронье hurriedly adverted her gaze away.

Speaking of Кирито, he turned towards the broken window. He seemed to rubbing his lips a little, thinking of something, but as soon as the couple finished changing clothes, he turned around and said.

"Is there any possibility that the arts master and minion who kidnapped Лизетта returned to the castle through another floor?"

Исукан frowned and mumbled in a disturbed tone.

"Um...... At this time all the windows should be locked, so if they broke in from outside the guards on each floor would have noticed. But...... if there was a stranger in the castle, he might have opened the window from inside..."

Шейта nodded and added in a crisp tone.

"Make all the guards search all over the castle."

"Can me and Ронье help with that?"

When Кирито offered, Исукан nodded without hesitation.

"I beg you, I need your power when the minion comes out. Here, take this."

He opened a small drawer in the top of a table, took out a silver necklace and passed it. When Кирито received with one hand, he put the thumb of the right hand to the silver ring of his forehead.

"This is a testimony of the army commander assistant. Show it and give my name, this will open most of the closed doors."

"I understand, thank you."

When Кирито hung the chain with a coat of arms engraved on a silver plate on his neck, Исукан came up to him and strongly grasped the shoulders of Премьер-Мечник.

"──── relying."

With this short word, he quickly left the room together with Шейта. When the door opened and closed, as if waiting for it, the 4 o'clock morning bells quietly rang.
