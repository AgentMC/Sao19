# Part 5

The distance from Мира Людей capital Centoria to Тёмной Территории capital Obsidia was about three thousand kilolu.

This is three days even by dragon that can fly a thousand kilolu a day. One month in the horse-drawn carriage, double that if walking. During the former Foreign World War, Emperor Vector, the commander of the Dark Army, moved 50000 troops from Obsidia to the Great Eastern Gate in five days using the dark art masters’ secret elixir and technique, which later was proved to be a terrible matter that permanently decreased the maximum value of life for every sub-human who drank it. Humans did not take elixir because they used horses or horse-drawn carriages, but sub-people who were walking were till that days in a state of reduced life, and Собор clerics were striving to find curation methods.

_Мира Людей Премьер-Мечник Кирито who quickly decided to visit Obsidia in response to this emergency situation, of course, would use a flying dragon, Ронье thought. The aerial element flight technique used to travel from Собор to the guards’ office in South Centoria consumes a lot of space sacred power, so it cannot be used for a long time in Тёмной Территории with low amount of resources.  
But he does not have his own mount, so he needs to ride Дюсольберт’s or Renri’s dragons. With a two-person ride, a dragon will be exhausted even faster, so I cannot ask to take me with him_ ─ and Ронье had given it up even before being instigated by Тейза.

However, willing at least to help with preparations for the trip, Ронье went from Flying Dragon Stables to the 30th floor of Собор where Премьер-Мечник's room was. Асуна greeted her and said that "Кирито-kun is in the arsenal" with a face expressing the mix of concerns and acceptance.

Sharing worried of Vice-Премьер-Мечник, she had to run a long distance again, down and behind Собор ── to the place where there was a former prison ── and upon getting there and moving down the wide ramp, she looked inside through a left open huge door.

Inside was a large space that seemed to be about thirty mel deep and on the left and right sides there were five or six young blacksmiths and clerics filling the space with powerful sound of hammering and swishing. And in the center, there was a huge artifact illuminated by countless light element chandeliers.

It was a "machine dragon", a metal dragon similar to Prototype 1, which had a big explosion the other day, and by its side chief of engineering master Садоре and Кирито were actively exchanging opinions...... strictly speaking, just yelling at each other.

"So, how many times should you say it, Kiri-boy! This baby is still in the process of adjustment, full force flight is impossible, even blockhead like you should be able to understand it!"

"Relax, master, this time I will only fly horizontally instead of vertical launch. Just replace those with wider wings so it can glide the air!"

"What the monkey is going on? So that’s what you say, the destination of my baby is the capital of the Тёмной Территории! No, we haven’t run flight tests yet, but suddenly I’m acknowledged there is someone who will fly it 6000 kilolu round-trip!"

"But it’s fine, this time thermal-element sealed container’s density is double the one of Version 1, and also master has carefully improved the fuselage. Even if I fly ten thousand kilolu, it won’t blow up. Don’t you think so?"

"Well, that's the case, this one you won’t break so easy, the level of fragility... No, no! Forget what I said. Every time I accept that kind of wheedling from your mouth, it is getting more troublesome than getting my ass stung by Oonumaab<sup><a href="#Prim1">1</a></sup>!"

Having heard their arguing, Ронье felt blood left her face. Кирито will neither use a dragon nor a coach, he intends to fly to Obsidia with this Machine Dragon v. 2. The recent catastrophe vividly revived in her mind, so she swayed her head and rushed towards those two.

"It’s dangerous, Кирито-сенпай! As chief engineer Садоре says, what would you do if something happens!"

"Oh, hey, Ронье, don’t get closer or you’ll have oil on your clothes"

Pulling Ронье's left arm away from the dragon for about 50 cen, Кирито laughed gently but then tightened his expression.

"Well, in these circumstances including the you-know-what thing, I have to, regrettably, fly by my own means. Because all the knights are busy and I cannot order anyone of them to get me to Obsidia, and if it is a horse it will take months.... The situation seems to be tenser than we thought, if we do not warn the Тёмной Территории regarding the situation as soon as possible, it may be too late..."

"............ But, there are other dangers, сенпай."

Ронье tried to persuade Кирито hard approaching one step closer.

"The one who killed the inn cleaner Yazen-сан and tried to put the crime to the mountain goblin Oroi was not bound by a Taboo Index. Then, they may also target Кирито leaving Centoria...... No, perhaps, this event itself might be a trap to compel сенпай to go to Obsidia!"

"Oh...... Indeed, there is a possibility of that..."

When she muttered this with a serious look, Кирито closed his mouth to think about something.

What broke the silence was a loud sigh of master Садоре.

"……so, me too, you know, exchanged a great deal of skills and knowledge blacksmiths from the Тёмной Территории. These days the world is like in a dream, and I don’t want to go back to old days."

"Hey...... Even such an old man as master, do you still have to learn anything?"

To the question of Кирито, Садоре made a frowning face squeezing his gray beard.

"Unfortunately, yes. The swords and armor of Dark Knights the Defense Army brought back from the battlefield, it was wonderfully crafted. To start with they have used original steel, type of which is unknown to me... Until now we don’t know the source of ore and the manufacturing method."

Садоре hit the outer plate of the silver-shining machine dragon with a big hand covered with countless scars and said.

"...... Kiri-boy, the thermal elements pressure meter says we’re up to 80%. And make sure to set small output opening."

"Oh, that’s truly master! The pressure is...... That's right,...... one kilome per one square cen."

"Wait a moment, please!"

Ронье hurriedly broken in the conversation between them.

"Aside from the safety of the dragon, there is still the danger of сенпай being targeted! To go alone to the Тёмной Территории, it is pretty much..."

As she was saying that, Ронье looked up at the head of the dragon and noticed something that made her suddenly close mouth.

The glass part surrounding the metal chair — what seems to be called "the cockpit" — was quite longer than the one of Version 1. Staring eagerly, she saw another chair attached to the back of the cockpit.

"............ hey, сенпай."

"...What is it?"

"Can this Version 2 possibly ride two people?"

"Um... err, well. Although the supply of cryogenic element for Version 1 wasn’t catching up and it had exploded, which was expected to some extent...... here it's supposed that two people will be able to generate enough cryogenic elements, but as I said earlier, the cooling power is enough to fly horizontally even with one person......."

Ронье interrupted that twisting more and more away explanation of Кирито, who probably felt some bad premonition, with a cough.

"I understood, сенпай, to deal with the danger of assassination, suggesting to take an escort."

"You as an escort?"

"Well, as сенпай said earlier, everyone among higher-rank knights is busy, so as a knight trainee, I will fulfill this mission responsibly!"

"Er… err?"

"Besides that, I can also help you monitor thermal element cans!"

"Eeeee~~r!?"

Before the reluctant Кирито says anything, Ронье's right fist hit her chest and left hand laid on the sword’s handle in the official knight salute, declaring an unvoiced command acceptance.

Next to perplexedly blinking Кирито, master Садоре made “**Gahhahha**” and smiled happily.

"I say, you lose, Kiri-boy. Nevertheless, Ронье-jochan<sup><a href="#Prim2">2</a></sup> has become quite resolute."

***

Although somehow Ронье managed to get an attendance permission from Кирито, from there it became serious.

Of course, it was the first time for her to visit Obsidia, the capital of the Тёмной Территории, but she also had no experience of the situation where she was going to be the Кирито’s only assistant. She had no idea on which exactly preparations should be done, and while she was grooming through a lot of small clothes accessories in her room on the twenty-second floor after returning back from the arsenal ──

Someone knocked the door suddenly, and Ронье who thought it would be Тейза ran to the entrance shouting “Yes!”.

"I’m OK, just lend me a hand to help packing......."

She started like that, but once the door opened, who was standing behind it was not her redhead friend, but a beautiful female swordsman with chestnut hair dropped over a pearl knight outfit.

"Ah ...... Асуна-сама!"

Асуна smiled gently and quickly stopped Ронье who was trying to hurriedly make a formal salute.

"Sorry for taking your time, Ронье-сан. There is a place I want you to come over for a moment..."

"...... Yes, wherever you say"

Ронье nodded, exited to corridor and started walking behind Асуна. 

Should it me the Академии Мастеров Меча in North Centoria, if a higher ranked student would call her this way, the expected development of the situation would involve surrounded by several students behind the school building saying something like "You are not getting a little rude lately, are you?", but of course such things didn’t happen in the Собор.

However, Ронье still felt quite uncomfortable having a one-on-one with Асуна. Even though the other party is a Vice-Премьер-Мечник of the Объединённого Совета Мира Людей, that was not a reason for her to come to Underworld from different world outside it. The reason was quite personal, such that couldn’t be confided to anyone ──

It was in the middle of the Foreign World War one year and three months ago that Асуна descended into the Underworld.

The Human Army decoy platoon Ронье and Тейза participated which was focused on distracting the Тёмной Территории army led by Emperor Vector was forced into a situation of complete destruction before it could fulfil the role of decoy. Ронье herself attacked the dark knight who had infiltrated behind the headquarters of the Мира Людей military, but her sword was beaten in a blink of an eye, and she already prepared for death — and then Асуна appeared there.

Floating in the jet-black night sky, Асуна with her pure and radiant appearance, was seen as no one else than Genesis God Stacia, drawn on the murals of the Arabel family house and pictures in the Академии Мастеров Меча. Асуна raised a rainbow shining sword and created a huge hole in the ground banishing the dark knight who was about to kill Ронье to the bottom of the earth. Ронье who witnessed that miracle believed without any doubt that Асуна is Stacia God herself.

Later Асуна as well as Кирито ─ and additionally, Emperor Vector and the dark knight Ронье fought ─ turned out to be "real world people". Nevertheless, Ронье's gratitude and respect never faded at all even after more than a year after the war.

But facing each other alone in such a way made Ронье's heart to throb fast.

That is because Асуна was "someone special to Кирито", which now was clear to anyone. Асуна got down to Underworld because I wanted to help Кирито who lost his consciousness at the time.

Whether they were talking casually at a sunny window, or passing a small vial of salt at a lunch, even when she was scolding the unreasonable Премьер-Мечник, Ронье strongly felt that Кирито and Асуна are tied with deep love.

_I never thought of interrupting between the two of them. And should it occur in the future...... that is not so far, probably, that the ritual of their marriage will be carried out, at that time I want to just sincerely bless them.  
But............... but. No matter how much time passes, the day when pain deep in my heart disappears, I feel like is never to come............__

Walking after her, Ронье had sunk so much in thought even during descending the stairs, she nearly walked into the back of Асуна when she had stopped in front.

She managed to avoid a collision and looked around, they were standing by a large armor storehouse on the third floor of Собор.

The relief over the massive gates depicting gods Solus and Terraria once stated that only Chief elder, knights’ commander and the Highest Priest herself were allowed to open it. Now anyone could visit if they write their name on the table next to the door, but of course it was not allowed to take the contents out.

Асуна wrote her name with a newly developed ink-filled copper pen on the sheet of "hemp paper", which was recently manufactured in the central capital from snow-white hemp fibers as a substitute for parchment, without hesitation opened the door and went inside. Since it was already the evening, there were no visitors, and the calming darkness welcomed them.

Асуна touched the glass tube beside the entrance and chanted a sacred art.

"System Call, Generate Luminous Element"

Using only one finger she generated ten light sources in the tube and then one wind element.

Under its pressure ten light sources moved in the tight pipe running along the wall and brightly illuminated the entire large armor store.

Just like hemp paper and copper pens, this "light tube" and the light chandelier of the arsenal were also developed by Кирито and Асуна. Unlike torches and oil lanterns, there was no danger of fire and light was also white and stable, however as it is contained in a glass tube, since the light reacts little by little with the glass and disappears, it was necessary for who can use sacred art to regularly supplement those. Although it is possible to completely replace oil lanterns in the Собор full of clerics, it seemed still impossible to spread it to entire city of Centoria.

As soon as it was illuminated by as many as 10 lights, the whole armor storehouse glowed brightly, and Ронье who barely entered here breathed lightly.

Many colorful armors were lined up in the area wide as a large training ground of the Академии Мастеров Меча, and numerous large and small swords, spears and axes were hung on high walls. There probably were some divine-class weapons awarded to senior Integrity Knights, but it was still impossible for trainee Ронье to distinguish them.

"... as usual, it is a wonderful view"

As Ронье let out the admiration voice, Асуна nodded.

"It is true. But, even this is quite a few to fulfill the needs of Lina’s, I mean, general Selrut’s Мира Людей Army. It seems Кирито wanted to release the majority and let them to be used equally for the support of Мира Людей and Тёмной Территории, but it was really opposed by Дюсольберт."

"Well, that's a difficult problem, is not it?"

She could only give that sort of an answer, as she felt shivers piercing her shoulders.

The importance of support of the Тёмной Территории was well understood to Ронье who saw the hungry mountain goblins children by her own eyes. But in her mind, words of Кирито still echoed: 『The war will start once again』.

_Should this ever be the case... I want families and students in the North Centoria, Собор knights and clerics and of course Тейза to be absolutely safe, and to guarantee that we should leave these weapons that are valuable assets_, — she thought.

Асуна standing behind her patted Ронье’s shoulder and said with a mischievous look on her face.

"So, hmm.... Integrity Knight trainee Ронье Arabel, how much is your current weapon control authority?"

"Er, wha…? Why does Асуна-сама asks such a thing..."

"It’s all right, it’s all right."

One looking into the face of the second greatest swordsman in the Мира Людей has to obey. Hey, I did not check it recently, what if it went down.... thinking this way, she drew a sign in the air with her left hand and lightly taped her right hand.

"Stacia’s window" appeared with a faint glow, was the representation of the ultimate essence of a person — something Кирито was calling "personal stats" — so was not polite to peep at other’s windows except for the cases of emergency. To protect her window from Асуна’s look, Ронье went one step behind her and then told the number in the row titled **【Object Control Authority】**.

"Err, it is 39<sup><a href="#Prim3">3</a></sup>......"

"Amazing, it's almost the same as numbered knights have."

Асуна smiled sweetly and went to the far wall murmuring "Well then.......". She moved through countless displayed one-handed swords of various colors and designs one after another, chose as much as four and holding them by two in each hand, arranged on a nearby bench.

"These are priorities 38 and 39. Choose whichever you like, Ронье-сан."

The unexpected words of Асуна made the other one speechless for several moments.

Speaking of Priority 39, it does not extend to the level of divine objects, but such a sword is still unique and categorized as a legendary one. Indeed, all four lined up on the bench were decorated with a wonderful decoration, and all polished like a mirror blades shined with different shades. Even "Four Oscillation Blades" reporting directly to Фанатио were using official style swords, the knight trainee could not even dream of such a gift.

"I ... could not .... Асуна-сама!"

When Ронье swung both hands and head at the same time, Асуна grinned and said.

"That gesture, it looks a bit like Кирито-kun"

"Well ... yeah... maybe ... ...."

"He-he, you do not have to hold back, Ронье-сан. I got permission from commander Фанатио and above all you are a brave person who fought through that war until the end."

"............... It’s such a..."

Once again, wiggle and waving.

"...... I was protected by Асуна and Renri, and many Мира Людей swordsmen, and swordsmen who came to the rescue from Real World...... When that black knight did terrible things against Кирито-сенпай, even though I was there, I could not do anything."

"Not at all, for sure."

Асуна suddenly made a step towards Ронье and gently pit her hands to Ронье's back. Although at first her body became completely stiff, sweet and refreshing scent of melati<sup><a href="#Prim4">4</a></sup> and gentle warmth quickly melt the tension.

"It was Ронье-сан and Тейза-сан, and Alice, who protected Кирито when he couldn’t move. For me, you are the true heroes... I won’t ever be able to thank you enough..."

Feeling tears covering her eyes from these words, Ронье muttered.

"Alice-сама...... Why did she leave......."

After a while Асуна responded with certainty.

"She is fine in the real world. She is the hope that ties the two worlds....... I'm sure, someday, we’ll meet again......"

Having applied some strength to both arms hugging Ронье, Асуна released her and smiled again.

"Now, pick a sword, this is not just you, it's also a weapon to protect Кирито-kun."

After such words she couldn’t refrain any longer.

Again, she looked at swords selected by Асуна. All four were straight swords for one hand, but grips and blades are somewhat slender, and it is understood that her selection matched not only the priority but also Ронье’s stature.

As it was discovered recently through steady Кирито’s analysis, top-ranking weapons, accessories and decorative items with priority exceeding 30, in addition to the value of the life displayed in the Stacia’s Window, it seems, were granting certain "hidden natural power", so to speak. It included a wide range of increased absorption of attribution attacks, poison, fatigue, dark arts, or, on the contrary, it could help to generate a specific element, in rare cases, the life recovery speed is increased or one becomes able to see in the night; they said, even strange effects such as being liked by dogs were discovered.

In addition, it turned out that divine objects the deceased Highest Priest Administrator had given to the Integrity Knights, had hidden natural power to strengthen the sacred art of those attribute which one was good at, which means not only weapons but also the capabilities of knights were available to Administrator in much more detailed form than the Stacia's Window. Currently, Собор's high-level clerics seem to be doing their best to implement the "sacred techniques to uncover hidden natural power", but it will take a long time... Кирито had said.

Four swords lined up in front of Ронье's eyes should also have different hidden natural powers, but from the appearance it couldn’t be seen at all. She could try using sacred art of all attributes equipping them in turn, or run around the Собор and then examine the recovery speed of her life, but this way she will feel faintly, which was not possible to afford as they were departing tomorrow early in the morning.

She felt that a faint voice came back from the depths of her memory when she was standing in the same way without knowing what to choose.

_......In the past, this sword was too heavy, even hard to lift, rather not to swing it._

The one who said that holding a beautiful long sword with a slightly bluish white blade, was the same person whom Тейза served as a valet, elite swordsman-in-training Yujio. Next to him elite swordsman-in-training Кирито smiled polishing his own black sword, and nearby tables had just boiled tea and freshly baked honey pie spreading a nice scent. It has been so long time ago, nearly two years have passed already since that old scene.

At that time Тейза and Ронье were first year students just entered the Northern Centoria’s Академии Мастеров Меча. Although it happened so that the results of their entrance exams were good and they were able to get the place among twelve people chosen from one hundred twenty applicants, they still had troubles handling as expected those platinum oak wooden swords of priority 15 they were given, so they asked сенпайs how to handle heavy swords.

Yujio easily lifted the "Blue Rose sword" that although looking delicate and slim was much heavier than steel made big two-handed swords, and continued.

『In theory, if swordsman’s weapon control authority exceeds the priority of the weapon, the sword will not be too heavy. But I think that the connection between a sword and a swordsman is such a thing that cannot be expressed by numbers only. Even weapons having lower priority than their owner’s authority will not respond to the will of the owner at the time of need if they don’t treat them seriously or do not handle normally. I could not swing this sword a long time ago not only because I did not have enough authority, but because my connection to this sword was not enough... I think that’s the way it is. 』

"Connection...... to the sword"

Hearing such words for the first time, Ронье and Тейза were greatly puzzled.

Both of them were children of the sixth, lowest class aristocracy, and their parents dreamed that their kids will grow up and succeed enough to be granted the forth class so they won’t be living in fear of the aristocratic right of senior aristocrats anymore, so they spare no expense to train their children sword technique. Foremost, if a wooden sword is broken with intense training, they will be happy to take a replacement. For both of them the sword is a dream...... or rather a tool to realize the dreams of their parents, not really their own, and at the same time they were the handcuffs that tied them prescribing their future.

So even if one said that a connection to a sword is essential, they could not understand that immediately.

To such two people, Yujio talked with a gentle smile.

"Not only the sword. Even clothes, shoes, tableware...... every single particle generated by sacred art, if you open your heart and share your love they will surely respond. Maybe, people too."

Then, Кирито who listened last two sentences silently stopped polishing "the sword of the night sky" — at that time simply called "black" ─ and deepened the mischievous smile.

"Yes, Yujio and myself have our minds open. For example, I have a connection to Yujio’s pie, and I hear it happily permits me to eat it."

"I'm sorry, but the moment I eat my pie I will be executing my connection with yours, Кирито."

When listening to that exchange, Ронье unexpectedly smiled and laughed. Laughing, she felt like she could understand the words of Yujio.

From that day on, with the permission of the dorm guardian those two decided to brush and polish platinum oak wooden swords from the training ground every day to heal the damage caused by training. It did not take a while until they become able to freely swing a wooden sword.

They hoped secretly that those enjoyable days at the Academy would continue forever. But only a month and a half later, Yujio and Кирито attacked other elite swordsmen-in-training with the Sword of the Blue Rose and the Sword of the Night Sky to help Тейза and Ронье and were taken to the Axiom Church. After that, when they escaped from the dungeon, they challenged the Axiom Church itself, breaking through the world's most powerful knights, and finally even defeated the Highest Priest Administrator who was the ruler of the Мира Людей. But in that fight Yujio lost his life and became the one who will never return.

Recalling the voice of Тейза striving to meet Yujio-сенпай, Ронье stretched her right hand without touching the tears that appeared once again.

_Swordsman does not choose a sword. It is the sword that picks the owner. Should I open my heart and pour love to them, any sword will surely respond._

Ронье's hands caught the third from left — a long sword with silver guard and pommel, with handle wrapped with rough black leather resembling Кирито’s hair, emitting a soft sheen. Brand new handle leather was a little hard feeling, but she thought that if she handles it with care it will soon become familiar with her palm.

She breathed in and exhaled, then gently lifted the sword.

Heavy. A heavy feeling of dense and resistant thing strongly transmitted from fingers through her wrist, elbow and shoulder to the core of the body.

_But it was not an unpleasant weight. Just like platinum oak wooden sword I was using as a junior swordsman trainee, just like an official sword of Мира Людей Defense Army we fought through two wars together, I feel like I’ll be able to handle this one freely someday if I take care of it with love._

She grasped the handle with her right hand and felt the essence of the sword by placing a blade on her left, then a gentle voice sounded.

"...... Is this sword OK?"

She firmly nodded to Асуна’s words.

The Vice-Премьер-Мечник put all the other three in sheaths, rested on the wall support, and then went around the bench and stood on the left side of Ронье.

"The name for this sword should be assigned by Ронье-сан. Go to the administration department once you decide, have them register it in the knight equipment ledger."

"......Yes."

It was the first time she had a sword that must be registered due to its significance, so she was a bit confused but nodded thinking that it is also an obligation of the owner. In the past it was the Highest Priest Administrator’s whimsy to build or destroy divine objects, give it to someone or take it back, but now all kinds of weapons and armor accessories in Собор are carefully managed by ledger.

Асуна nodded smiling, glanced at the left side of Ронье’s waist.

"What will you do with that sword? If you wish to return it to the Мира Людей army, I can deliver it to the headquarters with a tomorrow's messenger."

"Oh, ye... yes, I should..."

![Image](/Translate/Img/p115.jpg)

She would involuntarily begin to stammer in response to unexpected words.

The standard sword, which was always on her left hip, was owned by Ронье ── the sacred letter "P" would be shown indicating that she is the owner if she opens the Stacia’s Window ── but in the light of military rules of the Мира Людей Defense Army, it was a loan only. _When we renew our weapons and old ones become redundant we have to return them to the army._

Both handle and sheath were made of dark brown leather, and although its creation involved practically no decoration, it was still a sharp sword of priority 25 made from Crois steel<sup><a href="#Prim5">5</a></sup> which was southern specialty. It by no means was a cheap production, and because Ронье had carefully maintained it, plenty of life was still left.

Actually, it should have been exchanged to the standard sword of the Knights Order a year ago when she was appointed as an Integrity Knight trainee, but at that time she kept postponing it as she was too busy, so eventually both Ронье and Тейза remained attached to their previous sword and kept using it as it was.

However, if a new sword is offered from a Vice-Премьер-Мечник in such a way, she had to finally bid it farewell. ── However.

".................."

Holding a new sword with her right hand, she was still gently touching the handle of the standard sword with the left one; Асуна nodded and said.

"I understand that feeling. I also didn’t want to let go my first loved sword, so I annoyed Кирито-kun."

"Er…?"

Surprised, she stared at the face of Vice-Prime.

"Асуна-сама...... is that about Real World...?"

"Well, not exactly. Long ago, Кирито-kun and I were fighting together in a world that is neither a Real World nor an Underworld. To be precise...... Кирито-kun taught me how to fight when I knew nothing at all."

"So even Асуна-сама who is strong like God, had times like that......."

"That's right, I am not a god but same as Ронье-сан...... a human girl."

Looking at Асуна's smiling face, which seemed to be more beautiful than any human being is allowed to have, Ронье narrowed her eyes for a moment and asked.

"Em...... Асуна-сама, so how did you make yourself to let go your first sword?"

Асуна looked down at the palm of the right hand as if to miss the sensation of the sword, raised her face and answered.

"With the recommendation of Кирито-kun, I melt the sword... into a metal bar, its original form, and I made a new sword from that material. This way, he said, the soul of the sword will be transferred....... That person, he can be so badly sentimental about swords."

"Hehehe...... It looks very much like Кирито-сенпай."

Two people were laughing and giggling for some time, but eventually Асуна murmured "But".

"This story in current circumstances won’t help Ронье-сан...... I cannot melt the sword of the Мира Людей army, and furthermore, there is already a new sword in the first place..."

"...Well, I could decide after listening to your story. This sword will be returned to the human forces army."

She put the new sword back to the table, removed the standard sword together with the sheath from the clasp on the sword belt and handed it out to Асуна with both hands.

"Is it really okay...? If you ask Rina-сан, I think it is also possible to continue to own it......"

"No, it's really fine. I knew this sword is too light for me long ago....... I guess, someone next needs it."

"I understood. Well then, I will return this to the Human Army Headquarters with a messenger tomorrow."

Having received the standard sword with a gesture full of respect, Асуна hung it on the right side of her waist. Although the standard sword of the Мира Людей Army is said to be light, when it is combined with the sacred instrument "Radiant Light" on the left of her waist, it should be a considerable weight, but she returned to the opposite side of the bench with a gait that does not suggest any weight at all and presented a black leather sheath decorated with silverwork that she put there.

Ронье who lowered his head lowered his clasp to the sword belt when he put the sword in it. While feeling new weights throughout the body, Асуна suddenly stretched his spine straight and stared straight at Ронье.

"...Ронье-сан. Regarding Кирито-kun, thank you."

"Ah... sure!"

She answered reflexively, but remembering the situation, Ронье returned to the attitude of knight recitation.

"Integrity knight apprentice Ронье Arabel, will protect the Премьер-Мечник at the cost of my life!"

After Ронье replied correctly, Асуна smiled.

"Do not discard your life though. It is the best that you both come home safely, if you see Кирито-kun runs away, please escape as well."

Feeling something like a trembling of emotions in her words, Ронье asked still hesitating to lower his hands.

"......Er, really, does Асуна-сама wish to accompany him herself..?"

"Just a little bit"

It was a jokingly answer, but it was clear that the meaning behind her words was different. However, Vice-Премьер-Мечник shook her head a little and said even before Ронье opened her mouth to answer.

"Both me and Кирито-kun cannot leave Centoria at the same time now. There are a lot of decisions we have to take every day, and former senior aristocrats’ dissatisfaction with the Объединённого Совета Мира Людей is not going to disappear any time soon..."

"....... I’m sorry, it’s such a shame......."

As she reflexively lowered his head, Асуна blinked her eyes and smile to her.

"There’s nothing to apologize, Ронье-сан, what is it?"

"You see... I also came from a noble family and I never had any doubts about the aristocracy system of the Мира Людей until I met Кирито-сенпай..."

"But fathers of Ронье-сан and Тейза-сан were doing important work in the guard and the executive branch for a long time, did they not? It is entirely different from great aristocrats enjoying each day thanks to the forced hard labor of people living in their territory."

"............"

Ронье remained silent, keeping her head low feeling a great appreciation.

In the former Imperial Palace rising above the hill not far from Центральный Собор, former Imperial administration and Imperial guards were still operating at that time, so her father worked as a guard platoon leader the same way as before the war. But the Konoe Knights order that was previously present on the imperial guard was completely dismantled<sup><a href="#Prim6">6</a></sup>, the functions of guard offices were mostly transferred to the Мира Людей Defense Army led by General Solterina Selrut. In the future, it seemed, all of the four platoons remaining in four empires will be integrated into the Defense Army and the size of military itself will be reduced. It is natural since the Dark World threat has already passed, but should this happen, Ронье was not sure whether her father will remain in his present position.

If he is ordered to rearrange within the platoon or transfer to an administrative office, her father will continue to fulfill his duties properly. _Even if we lose the enormous amount of income from labor of lenders by the Private Estate Liberation Act and he is going to work in the executive branch or the Мира Людей Army, it will still be different from great aristocrats trying not to serve themselves at any cost......_ so Ронье thought.

But even this way her father, and perhaps Ронье herself, will still feel it in their hearts. Perception that they are noblemen and different from general people. As long as that class mindset passed from generation to generation has not disappeared, both Ронье and people of Arabel family would remain essentially the same as the senior nobility.

"Асуна-сама, better to......"

Ронье managed somehow to interrupt words that were almost out of her mouth.

_Not only the noble grades, it would be better to abolish the aristocratic system itself._

She thought so, but it wasn’t a good thing to say while aiming at the Мира Людей highest rank of Integrity Knight herself. And the wish to become a knight can never be thrown away. Being given the glorious knight number, the silver armor, and the dragon, she would continue to serve Кирито for the rest of her life... because that was the only true dream of Ронье.

Асуна tilted the neck encouraging her to continue, and Ронье answered after shaking her head a little.

"No, it’s nothing...... But uh, if possible, could you let Тейза to get the same sword as this one...? Because she also still continues to use the sword of Мира Людей Army......"

"Yes, I'm going to get permission for Тейза-сан as well."

"That’s great, thank you very much."

_If after that Тейза also makes it to the same conclusion......_ thinking this way, Ронье swallowed the words she could not admit herself at all.

***

When two of them came out of the weapon storehouse where the light of luminous elements started to fade already, the 7 PM bell echoed around.

After writing the exit time in the journal, Асуна said that she would go to the general affairs section on the second floor and went down the main stairway. Ронье left alone again looked up at the night sky still shaded light purple through the big window in the front of the armor store and let out a heavy breath.

In the Академии Мастеров Меча where she was studying for only half a year, there was a rule that dinner must be finished by 7 PM, and if one was late without a good reason, that day they would be left without dinner. Of course, there was no such rule in Центральный Собор, it was possible to eat hot food at any time until 9 PM while big dining room on the 10th floor is open, and even later snacks are available in the large kitchen next to the dining room.

Today she ran around up and down, so supposedly she should had been hungry because of all those various activities, but somehow, she did not feel like eating that very moment, so Ронье decided to return to her room.

She used to ride an automatic elevator to Собор 22nd floor where her room was located, but that day she climbed the main stairs to get used to the weight of the new sword as soon as possible.

Кирито and Yujio, who escaped from the dungeon nearly two years ago, flew this staircase up to the 50th floor fighting Integrity Knights. There were no signs of fierce battle left, except for the feeling of two people being chased at that time, and just like them she moved her legs and eventually arrived to the 22nd floor with a little dyspnea.

A private room on the right side of the corridor a little ahead was still a double room shared with Тейза because of their trainee rank, but here friend was not in the room. She thought that Тейза has probably gone to dinner, and went to her bedroom through a shared living room.

As a coincidence, the living room and two bedrooms structure was exactly the same as the room of the elite swordsman-in-training dormitory where Кирито and Yujio were living, but each room was quite large here. Her room at the parents' house where she spent her childhood until entering the Академии Мастеров Меча was about half of these, so Ронье felt too restless because of its size from the very beginning, but in the end, took her time to arrange favorite furniture and restyle it many times, as a result it finally felt comfortable to live.

Looking from the entrance, the wall on the back had a large window facing East Centoria, a bed with linen was on the left and there was a small table on the right. And the wall on the opposite side from the window there was a lighting deВице-like the one in the armor storehouse. She entered the room, removed the sword from the waist and gently placed it by the wall; the black leather sheath fitted well to the interior with many dark brown furniture.

"I’ll think carefully, and will give you a name that suits you."

She whispered to the sword, removed the gray light armor and fixed it quickly on the armor stand on the right side of the sword rest. She would want to throw the body that immediately felt lighter to the bed, but had to endure. In preparation for a long trip from tomorrow, she must pack things well.

From Кирито she learned that the luggage should be one medium-sized bag available to knights, so she had to select things quite carefully. As girl reaching 17 years old that year she would of course like to take as many dresses as possible, but as a guardian of Кирито she knew it was not just a trip, she should give priority to medicines and sacred art media. First of all, she checked the medium at hand and would have to refill missing items with the management department, but before that ──

"............... bath, let’s go..."

Muttering that and having prepared the changing underwear, Ронье left the room.

Bathrooms were located on each floor of a residential area from the 20th to the 30th floor of Собор, so both Ронье and Тейза usually bathed there. But occasionally...... especially before leaving Собор for long, she would definitely want to go over there.

She walked along the aisle to the elevator area in the northern part of the floor. Aligned the control knob to the mark of 90th floor at the top and pushed the metal button; the aerial element contained in a sealed can at the bottom of the elevator was released as requested, and began to raising Ронье.

After several tens of seconds, the elevator gradually slowed down and eventually locked in, and Ронье opened the metal door.

When she exited there was a short passage divided into the left and right ways ahead. And, before the branch, a pure white cloth hung down from the ceiling with strange text "ゆ"<sup><a href="#Prim7">7</a></sup> written in black with a strange font.

This hanging cloth was attached by the Премьер-Мечник Кирито, and it seemed he had written the character himself, but no one knew what it was intended for. They said, Vice-Prime Асуна seemed to be the only one who knew it but remained silent and just laughed with surprised expression.

Tilting her head as she was walking through this passageway, she lifted the cloth with "ゆ" lower half of which was cut into strips, and reached the branch point. More hanging cloths of same design appeared on the left and right.

The blue cloth on the right side had "men" written in white letters. The pink cloth of the left had "women".

The meaning of these signs can be understood with no effort ─ which didn’t help at all with the mystery of “ゆ” ─ so, she went through the cloth with "women". The aisle bent to the right and ended with a little wider room.

The room with a large shelf installed as a partition wall was not empty, three female clerics wearing only thin eastern style kimonos sat on wall chairs wiping wet hair. As they noticed Ронье they hurriedly got up and put hands together.

Women bowed to the level of their waists and greeted her keeping their head down.

"Good evening, knight-сама" "Greetings, knight-сама" "Good evening"

Ронье returned the greeting bowing to the waist as well, and hurried toward the opposite side of the room. When she reached the shade of the shelf, she breathed out. It was not yesterday or the day before yesterday that she was appointed as a knight trainee, but she was still not getting used to such admiring attitude especially from older people of same gender. She couldn’t grasp how to display such a dignified demeanor how knights’ commander Фанатио and even ordered knights do.

Having undressed and put her clothes together with the change she brought into basket inside the shelf, Ронье wrapped white towel around her body and opened the glass door in the back.

White steam immediately started pouting inside so she quickly did a step ahead and closed the door behind her.

The steam dissipated unhiding a scene that she could not stop to adore even though she saw it number of times.

A vast space taking almost half of the 90th floor of the Собор. Both the floor and pillars are made of pure white marble, the southern and eastern walls were huge solid pieces of glass, so one could overlook the night view of the central capital Centoria. Even this alone would be a luxury exceeding one of the former Imperial Palace, but the truly amazing thing was the huge amount of hot water filling all the floor surfaces falling down in a staircase pattern.

The length of the elongated hall from north to south was about 40 mel, the width reached 25 mel. The width of the surrounding track was 2 mel, and since the depth from the floor to the bottom of the bath was one mel, simple calculation suggested that total amount of hot water in the bath was equal to 874 cubic mel, and converted to the "lil" which was a unit of the liquid volume, the result would be a huge figure of 874000 lil<sup><a href="#Prim8">8</a></sup>. Moreover, the west side across the marble wall — that is, the one marked with hanging cloth with "men" on it, had completely symmetrical structure, so the total amount of hot water is doubled.

This place was a large public bath that Кирито called "the most luxurious facility in Центральный Собор".

Before the Foreign World War, only thirty Integrity Knights could use it, there was no middle wall, and it seems it was quite often case that only a single person was soaking in this bathtub. However, along with organization restructuring, it was opened to all Собор clerics and staff, and at the same time male and female sections were separated.

About twenty people were bathing at that time, but there was no impression that the bathtub wide as a little lake was crowded. Still, she walked to the southeast corner where fewer people were, slowly submerged her toe in transparent water. At first it felt hot, but soon she got used to it, went down the marble staircase and sit on the last step.

Immersing in hot water to the neck brought a feeling of deep relaxation to the core of the head that cannot be enjoyed in a bathtub of common size in the residential area, and she let a breath out.

"Huu............"

"Well, a huge bath is good, is it not?"

"It really is…………"

She nodded, then opened her eyes wide. Someone was sitting on the left completely unnoticed till that moment.

A tear appeared in the steam raising from the hot water, and as soon as that person's face was exposed, Ронье was once again bend backwards, surprised.

Light-brown hair so short that wet ends were sticking to the nape, crisp large light-blue eyes.

The body of one sitting higher than Ронье was a child delicate ─ but behind that appearance suggesting a girl of about ten years old was something by no means as innocent as it looked.

"Good… good evening, Fizel-сама"

The girl flying her fingertips over the water surface reacted the way similar to Ронье herself greeted just now by three clerics in the undressing room.

"There is no need in that “sama”. Ронье is older."

"But...... but Fizel-сама is a numbered knight......."

"Ugh, I feel like I had this dialog for about a hundred times already."

The name of the girl who floated her stretched body on the water surface kicking the water with both feet was Fizel Synthesis Twenty-nine.

During the Foreign World War she had a special titled being "numbered trainee", but after it she soon got publicly promoted and now she was a genuine Integrity Knight. She was given silver armor made according to her physique and a dragon named "Himawari"<sup><a href="#Prim9">9</a></sup> and Recently she was mainly flying around the Мира Людей with intelligence missions.

"Fizel-сама, I haven’t seen you for a while, have you been at a mission again?"

To Ронье's question, Fizel nodded and brought her mouth from under hot water.

"Yeah, the latest movements of the western Emperor’s Konoe Knights’ remnants were somewhat suspicious, so we were sent out explore. Linel is still over there, I have just returned for reporting and picking up some supplies."

"Thank you very much for your hard work...... Ardales Wesdarath V of the Western Empire was the only one of the four emperors we could not find traces of...... Is it related to that?"

"Hmm, the Western Imperial Palace was destroyed and burned out to the ground by Фанатио-onēsama’s memory release technique. I don’t think that the Emperor-ojiichan<sup><a href="#Prim10">10</a></sup> survived that explosion, but there were other people who wanted to save their miserable lives."

It couldn’t be imagined that such words were spoken by a ten-year-old kid blowing bubbles on the water surface, Fizel was certainly not of the age she looked like. Her friend, Integrity Knight Linel Synthesis Twenty-eight, and her were both born within Собор, but never received the "Synthesis Ritual"; they said that when the Highest Priest Administrator appointed them as Integrity Knight trainees, for some reason a sacred art had been performed to freeze their life before it had a chance to reach its maximum value. In other words, one couldn’t judge their age from their appearance ─ they simply did not grow any more.

Considering that, even though Ронье for some reason had a wish to tightly hug Fizel & the other one, she would have never done it. Apart from the fact that they were Integrity Knights, to become a numbered trainee they had killed knights who previously took that number; they tried to paralyze Кирито and Yujio with a poisonous sword and take head off their neck; those two got rid of the majority of goblin troops that had invaded the back of the Мира Людей Defense Army at the time of a Foreign World War, — there were a number of horrible rumors. If one speaks directly like this showing not even a glimpse of fear, there is no doubt that she is a kind of person requiring appropriate respect.

"So then, Ронье-chan…"

Unexpectedly her name was called, and Ронье straightened his spine in hot water.

"Ye…yes!"

"I heard that~"

Fizel grinned floating on the water surface.

"…as a companion of Кирито, you go to Obsidia?"

"Err, well, that......."

Кирито and Ронье's route beyond the Тёмной Территории boundary was supposed to be a secret mission, but she thought it would be useless to try hiding it from a Собор's best intelligence agent, so she nodded.

"......Yeah, I do."

"Souvenirs should be a selection of secret elixirs from dark arts masters’ guild~"

"................ I will do my best..."

"Ha-ha, I’m joking, joking."

After displaying an innocent smile suitable for her age, Fizel sitting on the higher step turned her gaze outside the glass window.

![Image](/Translate/Img/p131.jpg)

In the direction Fizel was looking, the light of East Centoria city was blinking like stars in the abyss of dark. Traditionally in East Centoria there were many wooden buildings, so wooden and stone torches were used instead of oil lanterns, which made the city light to gain a kind of soft color.

_Far away beyond that light, "The Great Eastern Gate" rises in over 750 kilolu and the capital of Тёмной Территории Obsidia is even further, in more than two thousand kilolu. They taught us at the Академии Мастеров Меча that its name means "the capital made of obsidian" in ancient sacred words, but the teacher did not seem to know its origin. Will I understand it when see with my own eyes, will I really go to the end in the first place to reach that city, or will it be too late and the overwhelming emotions will capture me same way as ──_

"When you get over there......."

As Fizel muttered closely, Ронье returned her gaze to a young сенпай knight.

"Yes……?"

"Hmm... the war is over and I do not care too much, but ..."

There was no person in the vicinity and no one could hear the conversation of two people with the sound of all the hot water flowing down vigorously from gates in the wall, but when Fizel approached Ронье and whispered with a serious face.

"In Obsidia, keep your eyes open, be careful everywhere."

"Ye...yes...."

"Although the "Peace Treaty of the Five Peoples" has been signed, the Тёмной Территории is still dominated by "Закону Сильнейшего". The strongest one now is the Тёмной Территории United Forces commander Исукан, and there’s Шейта as well, so I guess from the surface it looks like they firmly suppress it, but...... Even on this side that is supposed to be bound by many ties of the Taboo Index and Мира Людей Fundamental Law, there are still people who are disinterested in obeying them and find loopholes in the text interpreting it conveniently. So, if it is a Тёмной Территории that obeys much more ambiguous things than taboo or law, there is no wonder if some bad guys are hiding there."

Realizing the words of Fizel, Ронье was attacked by a feeling of hot water suddenly dropping the temperature. She started to shake a little, but Fizel stretched her right hand and tapped Ронье’s head.

"Sorry, sorry, I did not mean to scare you."

"No, it's okay. I will carve your admonition in my heart."

"Since our duties will be over by the time Ронье-chan comes back, let's invite Тейза-chan and have a party."

"Yes, by all means!"

As Ронье nodded, Fizel smiled and stood up.

"Well, then, I will have to get up early."

Waving with her right hand, the girl knight stepped on a slippery marble and left, so Ронье relaxed again.

Fizel's knight number is 29, thirtieth was the "Knight of the Fragrant Olive" Alice who left for the real world in the end of the Foreign World War, thirty-first was the "Frost Scale Whip" Eldrie who had fallen defending Alice. Since the numbers will continue after these two will be missing, if Ронье and Тейза are appointed as Integrity Knights, one of them will get the number thirty-two and the other one becomes thirty-third.

She certainly couldn’t wait for that day. But at the same time, the feeling of uncertainty was strangling her because she could not decide yet if she’s ready. Ронье at that time had sword skill, sacred art mastery and strength of mind way lower than even those of children Fizel and Linel, not to mention higher ranking knights like Renri.

_Step by step.  
I’ll move one step at a time. If you continue to train every day and learn seriously, you will definitely be able to reach where you aim._

"............ Ронье Synthesis Thirty-three ............"

She unwillingly muttered such a name and hurriedly looked around. Even though no one seemed to hear, Ронье dived in hot water to hide from embarrassment that was too big and continued to spit out bubbles until the air ended up.

## Примечания:

1. <a name="Prim1"></a>Poisonous plant, unique to Underworld, used in manufacture. 
2. <a name="Prim2"></a>嬢 means unmarried woman, girl; 嬢ちゃん, respectively, cute little girl, “cutie”.
3. <a name="Prim3"></a>BTW, the priority and OCA here and below are written using western notation, e.g. "39" instead of "三十九", in other words, it’s “sacred numbers” that characters _pronounce_ "thirty-nine" or something like this.
4. <a name="Prim4"></a>Indian jasmine, _Jasminum sambac_
5. <a name="Prim5"></a>クロイス, probably a reference to “Legend of Heroes” series.
6. <a name="Prim6"></a>Here “Konoe Knights” should be treated as “personal Emperor’s guards”; the “Prologue III” from vol.18 contains a spoiler that unveils what will happen in Underworld with this role in the future.
7. <a name="Prim7"></a>“Yu”, or specifically kanji “湯” means hot water or hot springs. Based on the following paragraphs it seems that hot springs are not simulated by Main Visualizer — which I personally find hard to believe given who built it, but OK — so the only “yu” in Underworld should be “弓”, a bow, which is actually pronounced “yumi” but can be shortened to “yu”. You can have a glimpse of the look of cloth [here](https://ojiya-chijimi.jp/archives/31862). It is quite obvious that it serves as a pseudo-door to hot springs/hot tub area.
8. <a name="Prim8"></a>The quick #KawaharaMath calculation is obviously wrong because it ignores the fact of the “floor surfaces falling down in a staircase pattern”. Depending on whether those steps are included in 25m calculation or excluded, and on the form of steps, we get significantly more or less than 874 m<sup>3</sup>, but under no condition exactly that number. Well, at least these numbers suggest the width of Catherdal’s outer wall: ~55m (25+2+wall+2+25).
9. <a name="Prim9"></a>閑割, something like Leisure Splitter per kanji, however in this case furigana ヒマワリ is also an homonym to ひまわり which means Sunflower.
10. <a name="Prim10"></a>Fizel calls Фанатио “higher ranked older sister”. Emperor is more complicated. It’s like Fizel calls him her direct beloved grandpa, but in a somewhat official form that would be probably used by someone who is visually older than her.
