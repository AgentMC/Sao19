# Part 9

Кирито and Ронье returned to their apartment, changed from sleeping to regular clothes, equipped swords and began searching first from the forty-ninth floor.

However, they did not open the doors of all the rooms. Кирито has a mighty mind power to find the location of Шейта from the other side of the river, because he could sense the presence of humans and monsters through doors and walls, it was sufficient just to concentrate on the center of each floor for a while.

For two hours they continued the search running down from floor to floor occasionally showing the coat of arms plate every time guards seen them.

Finally, at the third basement floor, which was the lowest level of Obsidia castle and contained a large storehouse, Кирито closed the eyelids standing at the center of the passage crossing — and slowly shook his head.

"No, they are not here either."

Having deeply sighed, he put his back against the black rock wall. The storehouse was completely unmanned, only the light of ore lantern shook weakly in the silent pathway.

Looking at Кирито’s worried face, Ронье nervously asked him.

"Then, doesn’t it mean that they weren’t still inside the castle but escaped to the outside...?"

"Ugh......... but that means that a hurt minion flew more than three kilolu in just two minutes..."

"Th-three kilolu......? Do сенпай’s senses reach so far...?"

"It depends on the target, but it's definitely about that if the opponent is the size of a minion with nothing around it. It’s 1.5 kilolu per minute, so ninety kilolu per hour...... I do not think minions that can fly at such a furious speed exist."

"It's almost like a dragon.... After all, maybe a dark knight on a dragon cooperated...?"

When Ронье asked, whispering, Кирито shook his head again.

"I can perceive a thing of a dragon size even if it is ten kilolu away<sup><a href="#Prim1">1</a></sup>. It’s not really a dragon that can fly so much in two minutes<sup><a href="#Prim2">2</a></sup>, it is rather a machine dragon..."

He cut off the word, and murmured "It can’t be", but immediately denied it.

"No...... If you use machine dragon, you should hear a terrible roaring sound. Not so much of a "stone mill drums" sound.... ── To start with, what sounds like a stone mill drum?"

Listening to it, Ронье thought hard, but I could not invent anything.

Instead she recollected the warmth of Лизетта drinking milk in her arms and laughing at the dinner. When Ронье pressed a hand to her chest, Кирито said it to her.

"Лизетта is the hope for two worlds, never gonna let this child be killed..."

In his deeply concerned voice, she felt a clear determination, and Ронье breathed in.

The face of Кирито who was leaning against the stone wall was down and covered with shadows so she could not see it. However, Ронье feverishly walked to him and grasped both shoulders of Кирито.

"....... unthinkable, сенпай. It is absolutely unthinkable to sacrifice Кирито-сенпай."

After keeping being silent for a while, Кирито answered, pausing after each phrase.

"I said before. If I die in this world, I won’t really die. If Лизетта cannot be secured, I......."

Ронье cut his words about that he should die by screaming at him.

"Senseless! Whatever a reason is, it does not matter... I can’t even think of never meeting my сенпай again......!"

She pushed her face straight into Кирито's chest. The silver coat of arms plate bit the forehead, but such a pain was nothing compared to the tearing apart aching in the chest.

"For my entire life, to follow and serve my сенпай. I decided to stay at сенпай’s side forever. I do not want anything more than that.... But if сенпай is sacrificed, I will follow you as well. Let us be executed together!"

![Image](/Translate/Img/p235.jpg)

She was consciously saying it in a way that suggested her becoming a hostage. But at the same time, it was Ронье's true thoughts, without any bargain.

".......Ронье..."

Calling the name with anguish, low, hoarse voice, Кирито lifted both hands and put them on Ронье's shoulders.

Кирито felt that way because he understood, it was possible to completely detain Ронье or put her to sleep even for two or three days — until everything is over. But such a thing had no meaning. If Кирито was executed when she awoke, she would follow him immediately.

However, Кирито moved his right hand to Ронье’s head and gently stroked her hair, whispering.

"...Thank you, Ронье. I will not give up. I’ll certainly save Лизетта... And then, Ронье and I, we’ll return to Собор. To the place of our home..."

As soon as she heard the words, tears flowed from Ронье’s both eyes. She nodded desperately struggling to speak over the crying.

"............ Yes...... Yes......."

Given up trying to say anything, Ронье just squeezed Кирито's body even stronger. Кирито had been stroking her head all the time until Ронье calmed down.

***

Soon after that, listening to the six o'clock morning bells they ascended to the hall of the first floor above the ground, to meet Шейта and Исукан coming back from the dark arts masters’ guild headquarters.

They got together and shared stories but unfortunately it seems that it wasn’t possible to get any information directly related to kidnappers.

"The current guild master has nothing to do with the dark arts masters mysteriously disappeared in a Foreign World War, and she did not run minions improvement experiments. I asked them as the commander, they couldn’t overcome the “Закону Сильнейшего”."

Шейта added to the words of Исукан after nodding with a depressed expression.

"However, there’s one thing...... About one month ago, it seems that from the clay production site managed by the guild, large quantities of the best-quality prepared clay disappeared."

"Large quantities...... how much exactly?"

When Кирито asked, Исукан answered with a bitter face.

"Just about of three minions size. They handled the matter internally and did not report to the Five Clans Conference...... well, even if we had heard it in advance, we could not have predicted today's raid...."

"A month ago or so...... after all, it seems that this is linked with the affair in Мира Людей..."

This time it was Исукан who asked muttering Кирито.

"I already received reports from the guards... but how was your search?"

"Bad...... I searched the entire castle from the top floor to the lowest storage room, but neither minions nor Лизетта were found. If there are hidden rooms that even Исукан does not know about, it did not matter...... They couldn’t avoid my detection unless they hide in a completely disconnected portion of the space."

"Well if you say so... That means, they already escaped somewhere far..."

Исукан crushed the head with the silver ring on. His hands were gently held by Шейта who wrapped them with both hers.

In the silence of the hall, the sound of the castle’s large front door closing sounded gravely.

Not only the door itself but also the hinge around it seemed to have been carved off from obsidian, and the sound of heavy minerals rubbing each other was unique. It felt like she heard this sound reminding of a distant thunder recently, and Ронье traced her memory.

_It was that...... yes, at the time of the flight experiment of the machine dragon version 1 by the Центральный Собор. In order to save the dragon which would otherwise collide with the top of Собор, Асуна utilized the power of goddess Stacia and shifted the top of Собор from the 95th floor and up. Giant pieces of marble rubbed against each other, and it was just like that sound. 
Rock and rock...... Sound of rubbing. Just like a stone mill._

"...... That! Шейта-сама......."

Ронье ran over and stood in the front of the senior Integrity Knight and spoke excitedly.

"Is there a large obsidian door, like that big door, near Шейта-сама and Исукан-сама's bedroom?"

"Obsidian doors......? ── No, all the doors in the vicinity are made of wood and the exterior window bars are made of iron."

"Well, then is there any mechanism involving a rock rubbing against rock...?"

Кирито also opened his mouth when he heard this.

"The sounds of stone mill drums heard by the guards....... If there is something like a hidden door on the outer wall of the castle, it would sound this way... but......."

"If it's just a hidden door, they couldn’t cheat Кирито's nose... right?"

Исукан groaned this with arms folded.

"...Also, I’ve never heard that there is such a thing near our bedroom. Moreover, even if you make a hidden door on the outer side of the wall, no one can use it. Only someone who can fly."

"…hidden door... isn’t it perhaps...?"

Кирито who mumbled it turned his eyes to the ceiling of the hall.

"Исукан, you were saying that yourself. On top of this, 49th floor, there is a real top floor."

General commander and authorized ambassador inhaled at the same time.

".....Fif.... fiftieth floor you say....? But it's been always sealed, and the guards have confirmed the chain has not been touched."

"How about the outside? Isn’t there no window on the 50th floor?"

"............No ......... no ...... certainly......"

Escrow moved the head awkwardly.

"...... When Vector came down and ten clans of Тёмной Территории were gathered at that time, I certainly saw a window in the throne hall. But now, looking from the outside, there are only rocks above the 49th floor, no windows...."

"Well, that’s your answer."

Кирито said this in convinced tone.

"When Vector died and the sealing chain restored, the rocks of the outer wall moved and all the windows were blocked. The space became completely separated. The stone mill's sound heard by the guards was the sound the rock moved again."

"But... if that’s the case…"

Исукан, whose red copper skin suddenly became pale, continued in a quiet whispering.

"It is only Emperor Vector who can break the seal of the fiftieth floor ............... It means that he kidnapped Lisa............"

But although the face of fist fighter was covered with fear, he creaked his teeth.

Шейта broke the shivering silence with resolute words.

"Let's go, on the fiftieth floor"

Immediately, Кирито also nodded.

"Yes... we can find out something if we examine the door."

Исукан nodded shaking off the fear.

Four of them again ran up to the top of the castle without a single stop. Due to the extreme situation, at the second time Ронье was able to keep up without losing breath.

She stopped at the 49th floor and looked up at the continuing stairs. Whether the castle's hot water heating did not reach here or there were other reasons, cold air falling down from the dark staircase wrapped Ронье's legs.

"……let's go"

Исукан who declared this bravely, stepped on the stairs. Three people followed.

Even though it was only one more floor, going up the stairs felt longer than from the first floor to the forty-ninth floor somehow, but eventually they saw a black double door ahead. As they said, there were huge chains that seemed to have more than ten centimeters in width binding left and right doors. It's tightly wrapped, not hanging at all.

Исукан, who slowly walked down a short corridor in front of the big door, touched the gray chain with his right hand, and moaned "cold" and pulled it back. But then he reached out again and held the chain tightly this time. He dropped it down and pulled with all his might, but the chain did not move, even a faint metal sound didn’t echo.

"...... After all, I cannot break the seal......."

He touched the black door with his right hand close to the chain, then put his left hand there as well, then clung to the door with his right ear.

"I don’t hear anything...... But, if Lisa is in the castle, she can only be here..."

Fist fighter retreated several steps and slowly lowered his waist, taking the stance of a fist shoot.

A red flame wrapped his clenched right fist. The cold air trembled and shook, so Ронье unconsciously took a few steps back.

And when she thought he was going to destroy the sealing chain with a naked fist...... Кирито made a step ahead.

Walking up without any notion of being pushed back by the incarnation swirling around fist fighter's hand, he put his palm on the left shoulder of the latter.

"I'll do it, Исукан."

"No...... let me do it."

"We’ll need your fists when fighting minions and kidnappers, and I am good at this kind of things."

Hearing the words of Кирито that were calming down his fighting spirit, Исукан deeply breathed several times, then turned back and walked away, saying.

"As usual, leaving the best for yourself, asshole. I understood... go on."

With a bitter smile, he went back and stood by the side of his wife.

Кирито stood in front of the chain in his place, carefully stroking the dully shining chain with the spread ahead right hand. After repeating this exercise several times, he tapped a point in the center part of the chain many times with his index finger.

"Here... it is too small to be seen with one’s eyes, but there is definitely a scratch. Шейта-сан, isn’t it?"

Кирито asked the question without turning, and the Integrity Knight firmly nodded.

"Yes, I told you before. Should it have been a Black Lily Sword, I’d cut it through."

"I guess so...... This scratch, I’ll use it."

Кирито nodded and stepped three steps away from the chain, then finally grasped the sword at his left hip.

Looking at the sword pulled out with a sharp, clear sound, Исукан and Шейта faintly sighed.

The sacred treasure-class equipment "Sword of the Night Sky" was not made of metal, rather of a jet black slightly transparent material. It looked a lot like obsidian forming Obsidia castle, but it’s blade radiating clearly felt tremendous weight, was once a branch of the huge cedar tree rising in one of the forests of Norlangarth empire. Master Садоре, currently appointed as a head of engineering in Центральный Собор, polished the branch to become a long sword spending the time of an entire year and six grinding stones; with this sword Кирито had defeated numerous Integrity Knights, banished Chief Elder Chudelkin and the Highest Priest Administrator, and eventually slashed Emperor Vector of the Тёмной Территории. Indeed, the legendary sword that saved the world.

But probably, no matter how high is sword's priority, it alone cannot cut the sealing chain.

There was no doubt that the chain was given the same "non-destructive attribute" as the exterior wall of Центральный Собор and the Immortal Wall dividing the capital of Centoria into four parts. Even Асуна with her god-like power could move Собор's wall but wasn’t able to destroy it.

It was not sword skills or sword priority that could cut the chain, but the miraculous ability to rewrite "the matter of the world" — the power of incarnation.

Кирито went away three more steps, then stretched his left hand forward and pulled the right hand holding the Sword of the Night Sky behind his shoulder. Firmly pressed the floor with both legs spread forward and backward, breathed in heavily, and held it.

Кирито’s body who took a stance not of a traditional school was covered in red light. A tornado-like wind blew up from his feet, and Ронье was almost blown away, but stomped hard and kept on her feet.

Eventually the red light gathered in the sword he held in the right hand and made the jet-black material shine brightly. Newborn vibrating sound of a dry timbre, gradually increasing the volume, eventually became a booming metallic sound reminiscent of the dragon’s roar. The air trembled, obsidian floor and even walls shook a bit.

"Un...Unbelivab...le"

Moaned Исукан.

"This is... Кирито's incarnation..."

Even Шейта leaked a surprised voice.

Suddenly, the appearance of Кирито wearing only simple black trousers and shirt swayed in the raging wind and changed like a mirage ─ and became... The hem of the long black leather coat violently fluttered. The right side of the chest and both shoulders became dully glowed with steel armor.

"**OOOOOO\~**!!"

Кирито kicked the floor with a brief shout.

The sword in his right hand shot out in a straight line carrying all of his will. The roaring sound rose to the limit, and a fine crack ran on both left and right walls.

The distance to the chain was about 5 mel. It was clearly out of the range. However, as though it had extended the sword itself, crimson light formed a solid spear, that pierced through a point in the middle of the sealing chain.

The sound has gone, the light has gone, the wind has gone, the appearance of Кирито returned to his normal look.

In the silence, the sealing chain, without a sound, loosely dropped, divided into two in the middle. A heavy door trembled ── as if the door itself was revived, and a short heavy sound echoed.

Кирито fell on his knees on the floor and Ронье quickly ran to him.

"сенпай!"

She held him under the left arm with both hands and helped to stand up. Шейта and Исукан also ran to them.

"Hey, you OK, Кирито?"

To the voice of Исукан, Кирито lifted the left hand and answered.

"Ah...... I will recover soon. But that’s nothing, the door, quickly...... if the system, I mean, if the matter of the world finds something unusual, the chain may be repaired."

"Yeah!"

Шейта nodded, ran up to the big door and pressed both hands against obsidian panel that covered in sinister carvings. **Gogon**, the door trembled and slightly moved to the inside.

"……opened."

Кирито told Шейта who turned around in a blurred voice.

"Both of you hurry! If a kidnapper is inside, they are already aware that the door was opened... I will follow you soon!"

"**Oooo...oh\~**!"

Исукан nodded and kicked a huge door open with his right foot. The passage continued ahead, but was filled with darkness of a kind different to the place where Ронье stood, and freezing cold air flew out.

But Лизетта’s parents jumped into the passage without hesitation. Few seconds after the backs of two people disappeared in the dark, Кирито straightened, apparently only with his willpower, and looked at Ронье.

"Let’s go as well."

Hiding the concern of Кирито pushing himself to death, she nodded.

"……Yes!"

She also thought that maybe they should get the guards searching downstairs before entering the passage, but as Кирито said, it was a situation when every moment counted. Besides, if the enemy was a high-ranked dark arts master, there is a danger that there will be no help from guards who are swordsmen and less resistant to the dark arts.

What she could do at the very least, was to take out the small bottle of the sacred medicine from the bag on her waist, pull out the stopper and hand it to Кирито. Кирито drunk a bitter-sour taste liquid with a wry face, but said "thank you" leaking a bit of blood back to the bottle. He passed the doorway together with Ронье and they stepped into the dark passage.

It felt as if they passed through a transparent membrane. Hot water heating appeared not to not function here at all, and the whole body was caught in the air so cold that the white vapor was exhaled, but after a while they heard a faint voice that made Ронье forget the coldness and fear.

It was no doubt that the baby cried.

"............!"

They exchanged gazes with Кирито and began running.

The passageway bent to the left ahead. After turning, they saw a second door aside. A crying sound came from behind that open door.

When they jumped in, it was a huge space.

A dark red carpet on the floor. Columns with ugly monsters embossed on both sides. On the wall, a pale light-emitting ore lantern. And in the front, placed in the middle of double-height stage, a luxurious chair. No doubt that it was the throne where Emperor Vector had descended.

Исукан and Шейта stood side by side in the center of the hall. Further, a black monster was stretching out its wings — a minion.

And by the throne, there was someone like a shadow.

Shadow wore a black hooded robe, but the skirt and sleeves of that robe were blurry like smoke and the figure could not be seen clear. It was slim, and quite tall. In the right hand, a dagger shining in a venomous purple, with its tip stretching to a baby held by the left arm.

_The voice of crying Лизетта is so weak. She has been kept for over two hours in this cold, her life would have decreased considerably. I think, I should help immediately, but in this situation I cannot move even a bit._ The anger and irritation also transmitted from the backs of Шейта and Исукан.

Black robe kidnapper, have turned his gaze to Ронье and Кирито from the darkness behind the hood ─ or so it seemed. Immediately afterwards, a strange voice sounded, as if a beast or bird talking human words.

"...Well, so it was the Мира Людей Премьер-Мечник who slashed the sealing chain? This person is more troublesome than his reputation..."

From that voice, age and race could not be estimated. However, there was something that can be certainly felt.

"You bastard...... man! You’re not a dark arts master!"

When Исукан shouted, the kidnapper leaked a strange laughter.

"There are men among the Мира Людей clerics, aren’t they? Then, can’t a man be a dark arts master?"

"...No, that poison sword, it has a familiar look......Bastard, you are that dick from the assassins guild!"

"Sword, what about it...... Such a sword, anyone can use it, no? Maybe I’m a fist fighter you threw out of the team......?"

Again, the kidnapper laughed as if mocking, but suddenly gave a cold voice as if the person who was talking changed.

"The talk is over. This way you left no opportunity for public executions, but you can still deliver the head of a Премьер-Мечник. Authorized ambassador, your hands are great in slicing, so cut the head of the Премьер-Мечник now. Or your daughter won’t live."

His gray right hand protruded from the black robe bringing the dagger close to Лизетта’s face.

The backs of Исукан and Шейта strained as if made of stone.

That moment ──

**Kinn\~**! A sharp sound echoed, and the tip of the poison dagger was thrown away. The whole body of Лизетта was covered with a sphere of white light. The kidnapper almost dropped the baby but immediately caught the ball.

Лизетта did not do anything. But next to Ронье, the right hand of Кирито stretched straight in the direction of the throne emitting light of the same color. He was protecting the baby with an incarnational barrier.

"Шейта! Исукан!"

Кирито cried with a somewhat painful voice.

"I will not keep it for long! Лизетта......!"

**"O\~oyo!!**"

The whole body of Исукан who shouted back was covered with a light resembling a burning flame.

At the same time, a man in a black robe said a strange word. In response, the minion began to move.

"**Bushshaaaaa\~!**"

The roar of the monster was interrupted by the shout of a fist fighter.

"**U-ra-ra-ra-ra────!!**"

Исукан rushed and hit a belly of the minion with a burning fist. The monster's bulky body, bulged from the belly to the limbs and swelled──

And like a leather bag filled with liquid, it exploded with a large amount of dark black blood sprinkled around. Исукан accepted poisonous blood covering his entire body with his arms crossed.

Immediately afterwards, a slim shadow flashed from the back of Исукан. Шейта who avoided the direct hit by poisonous blood rushed to the throne at the speed which made her look like a gray spot.

"............ !!"

With the only sound being the sliced air, she made the sword blur through his right hand.

The right arm of the kidnapper holding a purple dagger was cut off from the shoulder and fell to the floor. Шейта threw her right hand to also cut the left arm that held Лизетта.

── However

Something small showed under the black hood, at the mouth.

Blowing needle.

Шейта quickly pulled up the left hand to stop the needle, but a delicate body immediately began to fall on the ground.

Firmly holding Лизетта protected by the sphere of light, a man in a black robe ran to the left side of the throne trying to slip away.

But there was only a black wall extending there, there was no escape anywhere.

*I won’t let you…….*

A storm of thoughts formed in her head, and in that moment, Ронье pulled out the sword and ran.

On the other side, kidnapper was rushing towards the wall with his black robe flipping. In his chest, a large jewel shined brightly in a red color.

The light of the same color ran through a part of the wall. A square separated from the obsidian wall and lifted resounding...... like an enigmatic stone mill drum, such as heavy rocks rubbing together.

The kidnapper holding Лизетта dashed towards the window that should have not existed.

The distance to the kidnapper was more than 10 mel. With Ронье's leg strength, it is not an option to reach him in a single leap.

*But I’ll get him. I’ll reach.*

"**Yaaaaa────!!**"

Ронье kicked off the floor, squeezing out everything from the bottom of the body.

A right hand brandished the sword. At that moment when the arm and sword melted in a solid move fit into a very precisely determined position and angle, the blade released a dazzling light-blue light.

Ронье's body accelerated as is pushed by an invisible hand. Drawing a pale trajectory in the air in a moment she covered the ten-mel distance in one go.

Aincrad style high speed rush technique, "Sonic Leap".

A secret sword move, which Кирито said to mean in sacred words "jumping with a speed of sound", cut the kidnapper’s left arm from the body.

Shortly after, Кирито's mental barrier disappeared, and Лизетта was thrown into the air.

The man in the black robe who lost both arms, even without stopping his feet and spilling a lot of blood, jumped on him window.

It may have been possible to knock the kidnapper down, should she proceed with further sword skill. But Ронье chose to stop moving and catch the Лизетта.

![Image](/Translate/Img/p253.jpg)

The kidnapper jumped into the window with the head in front. His figure disappeared, melting in the morning light.

At the same time, Ронье firmly caught the body of Лизетта with her left hand and hugged her to her chest. She crouched, put the sword on the floor, and wrapped the crying baby with both arms to warm the child.

"......Lisa-chan, don’t be scared. It’s all right now...... all right now......"

Whispering and softly stroking her cheek, soon she made whining to gradually come down and then a little hand touched Ронье's arm. On the left side, the sound of the closed window sounded again.

Until someone touched her back, Ронье kept holding the baby hard.

## Footnotes:

1. <a name="Prim1"></a>#KawaharaMath In vol.18 Кирито has been revived about 1500 to 2000 kilolu to the north of the World End Alter (see illustration). Not only was he able to locate the “huge heterogenous object” at least 1000 kilolu to the south (Alice would reach Alter in \~6 hours if Кирито flies at \~300 km/h, so Subtilizer who is slightly faster than 120 km/h being dragon’s max speed, let’s say, 150 km/h, would be in about 1100 km from Кирито at the moment of him finishing off Vasago), but also to fly these 1500 to 2000 kilolu with Асуна in hands (and 3 super-high-priority swords!) over even less productive area than “normal” Тёмной Территории where he can “fly in a stable manner” for 10 kilolu only.
