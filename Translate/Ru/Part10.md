# Part 10

Despite the fact that hundred guards spent half a day searching, the corpse of the kidnapper wasn’t found.

He jumped out with his arms lost from a height of nearly 500 mel. It seemed that there was no chance for him to survive, but Исукан, Шейта, and Кирито seemed not to be optimistic that the incident was over.

At four o’clock in the afternoon when all the operations inside the castle were finished, four people gathered again in the child's room where the window had been repaired.

In the arms of Шейта, Лизетта was cheerfully drinking milk as if she had completely forgotten about an incident. The castle doctors, together with Шейта, who is herself a high-level cleric, after thoroughly ascertaining the influence of poison and dark arts, fortunately, could not find any problems.

On the other hand, it was equal to not learning anything about kidnappers as well. The way to open the window of the 50th floor which should not be manipulated by anyone except the emperor Vector remained the greatest mystery.

"...... It may be totally irrelevant, but ..."

Ронье said, seeping a scented tea that resembled an apple aroma, non-existent in the Мира Людей.

"When the man tried to open the window, a big jewel fixed in his chest glowed red."

"Red jewel......?"

Кирито muttered, tilting his head at the same time as Шейта. There seems to be no idea coming to both of them.

However, Исукан, who was trying to chew a large cut of the fruit pie, knitted his eyebrow and muttered.

"That red gem...... Do you remember what the color was like, Ронье-jochan?"

Ронье replied, thinking this was the first time when the fist fighter leader called her name.

"Well, it wasn’t too bright... it was dark red, reminiscent of blood, or a sunset."

"Bloody red............... bloody hell......"

"Hey Исукан, it is foul play to stop at just "bloody hell", you know!"

Said Кирито resting his chin on hands<sup><a href="#Prim1">1</a></sup>.

"I’m not playing fool......"

Despite having a confused expression, Исукан explained.

"A stone like that was in the crown of the emperor Vector when he descended before the Foreign World War. The jewel he wore was just like that, I remembered somehow."

"Vector’s crown... It really does not make sense. That person was a thousand kilometers south of this place, killed by the knight chief Bercouli on a rock and died at once. When he later resurrected, he did not wear such a crown anymore. So, everything should have disappeared on a that rock."

"But you did not see it, did you?"

To Исукан’s point, Кирито only nodded "Well... ".

At that time, Кирито was in a state of unconsciousness. Integrity Knight Alice was the only one present in the vicinity of the Knight Chief Bercouli and the Emperor Vector, but she was no longer in Underworld.

Bercouli's body was carried by Alice with the dragon<sup><a href="#Prim2">2</a></sup> almost to the "Altar of the Completion"<sup><a href="#Prim3">3</a></sup>, and Кирито later took him back to Мира Людей. He was resting under a tombstone built in the center of the flower garden spreading in the southeastern part of Центральный Собор.

"...Indeed, there was no search for the place where Bercouli fought against Vector. It would be hard to identify now..."

Saying so with a tough face, Кирито turned his gaze to the window.

"...But if the power of a gem opened and closed the window of the fifteenth floor, there is definitely a possibility that it was belonging to Vector, as Исукан says. Although, who would know how to use it... and there is still a question of who that man who had it was in the first place.... ── What is that assassin guild you mentioned in the throne hall?"

Кирито asked so and turned around, Исукан replied with a voice full of disregard, after drinking a cup of tea<sup><a href="#Prim4">4</a></sup>.

"That's those guys who commit assassinations for living. Using poisons....... One of former Тёмной Территории Ten Clans, their head Fu Za was hit by the rebellious attack of the dark general Shuster and died. That is why the organization was ultimately weakened, and now they have not even joined the Five Clans Conference. I almost forgot of their existence, but... It is completely unbelievable that the black robe bastard is a guy of the assassin guild, and he managed to control a minion......."

"Together with the missing dark arts masters, we’ll investigate them better."

Шейта nodded deeply to his words.

"Yes, I will discuss this with the Knights Order and the Commercial Guild. I will not let such a mess occur in Obsidia anymore."

Кирито leaned forward to Исукан who declared this.

"In such a case, should you not ask for a cooperation from the dark arts masters’ guild? We all well-remember the deeds of D.I.L., and the obvious inhospitality of dark arts masters can’t be helped, but... it is better for them to protect the castle as much as possible. Only guards are unreliable for defending against arts."

"I wonder if the ear pain pays off."

Despite the bitter smile, Исукан shrugged and replied.

"But yes, certainly that's a way to go. That added to quarrels between humans around Obsidia, the problems of sub-humans trying to settle in shared areas, and problems alike.... ── Кирито, okay, how long can you stay here?"

This time it was already Исукан who tilted ahead, and Кирито strengthened his upper body.

"Well, of course I want to cooperate to the utmost, but... I will return to Мира Людей tonight, the problem over there has not been solved yet..."

"Oh, well, that's right, but... you see, I kinda… did not properly thank you for saving Лизетта, and there is still so much things to eat ..."

Looking at Исукан puffing his lips like a child, Кирито just smiled with an expression exposing a little bit of grief yet somewhat nostalgic.

"...... what is wrong?"

"Nothing...... The talk of Исукан reminded me an old friend. Well, a future meeting is scheduled next month, is not it? That time, I will get in with more people."

"All right, then, I’ll at least make arrangements for the last evening delicacy, something like a pile of Meh snake or maybe a living eel....... Anyway, this time I was really taken care of. I will never forget this kindness in my life."

Кирито firmly grasped the right hand which rising Исукан had stretched. Seeing those two, Лизетта joyfully laughed “**kya, kya**” in Шейта’s arms.

***

Кирито and Ронье, who took a few hours of nap in their apartment and finished a simple meal, departed from Obsidia Castle at 8 p.m.

This time, there was no need to paint the face with ointment, or to fly with incarnation. Шейта sent them to the place where the machine dragon was left by her loved dragon Yoiyobi.

She seemed to be surprised seeing the steel dragon, but apparently, she realized the possibilities of the machine dragon at once. Saying that if this is mass-produced, the day will come when the travel between Мира Людей and Тёмной Территории is simple and enjoyable, Шейта returned to the castle of Obsidia which was her place of assignment and home as well; Кирито and Ронье also got into the dragon and flew to the western sky.

When the flight stabilized, after exhaling a long breath, Кирито in the front seat said.

"Anyway, that "Sonic Leap" when you secured Лизетта from the kidnapper was awesome, Ронье. When did you raise your skills so much?"

"T-that... w-was, like they say, just trance......"

Shortening her neck, she touched gently the silver guard of the loved sword laid in the gap between the chair and the wall.

"...At that time, it seems that the sword has lent its power. In your shoes I could not jump that distance, absolutely."

"W-well... that's a good sword."

"Yes."

He nodded, and Ронье entrusted her body to the back of the seat.

As they flew, through the transparent windshield one could see the night sky of the Тёмной Территории. There were fewer stars compared to Мира Людей, but a big crescent moon was shining white in the middle of the sky.

_Мира Людей and Тёмной Территории are far apart, but the people living in both worlds are watching the same moon...._

At the moment when she thought so, the same mysterious sensation came as when she saw a sign of an inn in Obsidia castle town and when she heard the melody of the hour bells, but this time Ронье caught the thought.

"Ah... that, Кирито-сенпай."

"Hmm? What is it?"

"Um...... Why are people using the same words and letters in Мира Людей and Тёмной Территории? Since the birth of Underworld, there were few exchanges between the two worlds, so it would be no wonder even if we use completely different languages..."

She could have never thought of this before, until she saw the world with her own eyes, so Ронье wanted to know the reason and asked this to Кирито.

A swordsman born in a real world answered after keeping silent for a while.

"Thing is... the real world people who created this world were to bring Мира Людей and Тёмной Территории into conflict, so it was better for them to have two lands speaking completely different languages. If we cannot communicate, we cannot negotiate peace. But they...... or something other than Real World persons intentionally made the language common. I do not understand why. But perhaps it may be because it creates the world able to overcome hostility and conflict............"

The words of Кирито were too difficult for Ронье. However, she did not seek further explanation and kept thinking hard.

_Кирито said, Lunaria floating in the night sky is a giant sphere like this planet. That's why it’s waxing and waning in response to the light of Solus.  
If people live on Lunaria, they should see a crescent Earth just like me living here. If so, maybe they speak the same words. Maybe, like humans of this world, they live their lives making a lot of mistakes, fighting and shedding blood, yet still striving for a better world?_

Feeling as if the crescent moon floating quietly in the night sky was a cradle growing many lives, Ронье gently stretched her left hand towards Lunaria.

Returning her hand to the handle of the loved sword again, Ронье said.

"Oh, сенпай."

"Hmm……?"

"I decided on this sword's name, “Sword of the Moon Light”<sup><a href="#Prim5">5</a></sup>, I will name it."

"Oh, yes, it's a nice name, I'm sure it will protect Ронье."

After smiling and nodding "Yes!" to Кирито’s words, Ронье wiped away the running tear with her fingertip.

_I want to see Тейза soon.  
I want to tell my best friend who is swaying between missing the deceased elite swordsman Yujio and the proposal of the Knight Renri, what I had learned in this trip._

As if feeling Ронье’s thoughts, Кирито slightly increased the speed of the dragon.

Under the pale moonlight, the steel dragon continued its run on and on, to the west.

(THE END)

## Footnotes:

1. <a name="Prim1"></a>口を挟む, also means a specific gesture, confused look while holding a pen or pencil horizontally between a nose and an upper lip, but doesn’t look like they had pencils there.
2. <a name="Prim2"></a>Vol 18 says she was flying alone. Maybe I messed OCR so hard, or missed a paragraph, let’s wait for Defan to verify, but I’m pretty sure she was trying to reach the Altar ASAP, so additional weight would have been redundant.
3. <a name="Prim3"></a>I had remark on this in v18, but for English readers who decided not to fight the horrors of v18 enlate: the name Alice used there is not in the sacred language “World End Alter”, but rather translated version, where 果て(ha-te) is the word for utility-style work or operation finalization, mission fulfilment, e.g. the Underworld program success, so the translation should be ignorant and rude to all the Underworld dwellers. However, here Kawahara still uses it for some reason, probably for the same reason as using "sub-humans" term, to highlight the early days of Underworld multi-nation culture development.
4. <a name="Prim4"></a>Actually his voice is full of disgust, but I adjusted the adjective so it doesn’t read like the tea is awful.
