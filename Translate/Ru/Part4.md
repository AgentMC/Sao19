# Part 4

Next day, February 18th.

Ronye sitting at lunch understood that an incident just happened that shook even that single wish of her.

The low-ranking knight jumped in with wry face, kneeled by Kirito and cried out that ──

Mountain Goblin tourists murdered one Centoria citizen in Centoria’s Central Park.

***

State Prime Swordsman, and even Vice-Prime Swordsman who perhaps was bolder than the one, both opened their eyes wide and inhaled rapidly.

Kirito pondered briefly, then quickly put a knife and a fork and stood up.

"Asuna and Fanatio, please ask commanders of the Human World Defense Army and the squadron leads. Do regular missions only, do not attempt to any special measures regarding this case. ── Where are those of Goblin tribe now?"

The second half of a question was addressed to the low-ranking knight who brought the message. The kneeling knight still retaining the appearance of the boy, replied.

"Yeah, I heard that he is already imprisoned in the South Centoria guard office!"

"I understood, messenger, thanks for the effort!"

As soon as he said that, Kirito threw over his black suit and started walking away in long steps.

Ronye at last recovered from astonishment, stood up in a hurry and shouted from the other side of the big round table.

"I... I ask for permission to accompany you, Prime-dono!"

Kirito thought of that for a moment, and soon he nodded.

"I beg your pardon. Is it OK to have a little shortcut?"

"Well...... yes. Ehm......."

Ronye’s eyebrows jumped up as she ran after him. _There’s nothing to shortcut, Central Cathedral is located in the center of the circular central capital, it’s enough to run down the Cathedral stairway and leave the South Gate, that is already the city of South Centoria, the capital of the former Southacroith Empire. Important facilities such as the guard office should be along the main street that extends from the Cathedral and penetrates through the city, in other words, straight to the destination._

To Ronye’s unspoken question, Kirito replied with action. Without a doubt, he went to the balcony on the east side of the hall, not to the big door on the south side.

Ronye who followed him saw the view from the height of about 20 floors of Cathedral and thought: _no way!_

But Kirito saying “excuse me” had already wrapped his left arm around Ronye's body. There was no time for the heart to bounce.

**Biyu~n!** Strange sound echoed and her field of vision was covered by green light.

Immediately after, even before Ronye feeling that her body is lifted casually into the air had a chance to raise the voice, two people rushed out into the sky with fierce momentum.

Cathedral was immediately left behind. The vast city of the central capital spread in front of their eyes. It was not like being just fast. Although it seemed that their speed is likely to reach several times the maximum speed dragons can fly, wind pressure was hardly felt. _Air resistance is eliminated by wrapping our bodies with membrane constructed from aerial element, and it seems we are getting huge thrust by continuously bursting more aerial elements from behind.  
This is "aerial elements flight technique" which can be used only by Kirito in the entire Underworld_ ─ and when she realized that, two of them descended to the ground like a gale.

A mysterious sound echoed again, and the color of the vision restored. She blinked several times to shake away the attacking dizziness, just in front of the huge ─ although it couldn’t be compared to Cathedral, of course, ─ stone building. The rough texture wall cut out of the red sandstone is undoubtedly unique to South Centoria.

The front entrance at the top of the stone steps was guarded by two people dressed in thick armor. Kirito walked straight towards them raising large halberds without trying to hide caution scared with the sudden appearance of Ronye.

"Name yourselves!<sup><a href="#Prim1">1</a></sup>"

Despite inquired for identity, guards crossed their spears with clash, so Ronye cried out as quick as possible from behind Kirito.

"We’re from the Human World Union Council!"

The Integrity Knights coat of arms embroidered on the short cloak caught the gaze of the guards. Because she still was a trainee, there was no number that should normally be stamped at the bottom, but fortunately it still seemed to have demonstrated sufficient effectiveness. Guards swiftly took an upright posture and with high sound struck the stone ground with a halberds’ poles.

Kirito ran at once between two people. Ronye followed.

Ronye only now had noticed that the Prime Swordsman of the Human World Union Council had not even wearing cloak or mantle bearing a coat of arms. It was just a simple black hemp shirt and also black thick cotton trousers. Therefore, one couldn’t really blame the guards who did not recognize him.

The officials of the guard office were glancing surprisingly at his bad look, but Kirito headed straight to the stairs to the basement. As if he already knew where the problem goblin is held.

No, it seemed that was the case. When they ran down the stone steps halfway, a distinctive shriek squeaky voice arrived in Ronye's ears.

".......nything! Me not do anything! Not see anything!"

"Stop telling lies, you subhuman scum<sup><a href="#Prim2">2</a></sup>!"

A dull sound followed the rude voice.

The second basement floor of the guard office was a prison separated by a black grid. Saying of which, guardians who passed here before left footsteps in the faint dust covering the floor, so looked like it had not been used for many years. Naturally, criminals did not appear in the Human World in principle, and it was only in very rare cases when someone could not remember the vast provisions of Taboo Index and the Empire Fundamental Law end-to-end so "as a result had committed a petty offense" and was released. ── So far.

At the end of the passage there was a spacious room without iron bars, probably a place for interrogation. Clunky wooden desk was standing in the center of the dimly lit room, and who was lying face down there was definitely a still young mountain goblin. 

A tough guard was pressing down that small body from behind. And in the front, a man standing in the uniform of the captain swinging his long swords at a high rate.

"Let’s see if it continues that dirty lies even after one arm is cut away!"

The sword moved down barely reflecting the light of the candle.

_── Stop it!_

Ronnie tried to shout, but sooner than that ──

**Kin!** A sharp sound echoed, and sparks were scattered from the commander's sword as if it was struck by an invisible blade, it slipped out of his hand and stuck in the wall behind.

Kirito delivered a "sword of mind", a secret weapon of integrity knights. A young man wearing a black suit who fought off the captain’s sword ran with the full speed and cried jumping into the interrogation room without stopping.

"That’s all! Everything about this matter will as of now be taken over by the Human World Union Council!"

"Name yo......."

The captain who was gazing at the blown away sword, looked back and stared at Kirito with red face. His carefully trimmed mustache trembled and he was just about crying something loudly but his eyes captured the shoulder of Ronye.

The expression changed drastically again, and at the same time the color of the blood completely gone from their faces. The captain and his man quickly kneeled and drooped heads against Ronye rather than Kirito.

The opportunities of such worship from the people of Centoria have actually increased considerably. But she did not feel like getting used to it. Anyway, Ronye was only a student until one year and three months ago. She applied to the Human World Defense Army as a result of a Foreign World War, fought it feverishly with her sword and immediately became appointed as a knight trainee, so she could not learn something like resolution or dignity at all.

_Even if he is dressed properly, I couldn’t avoid this unbearable wish to disappear_, thought Ronye watching over Kirito’s actions.

A young man who could be easily seen as one of the citizens living in the central capital, first of all, nodded to calm down the mountain goblin youth who was quietly shaking the whole body and asked with a gentle voice.

"You, your name?"

The goblin blinked yellowish eyes violently, but soon responded feebly.

"............Oroi"

"Oroi? That decorative feathers, are they from the clan of Uboli of the hill?"

Goblin nodded carefully touching blue and yellow feathers extending from the leather wrapped around the forehead.

"Ok, my name is Kirito and I am the Prime of the Human World Union Council."

As soon as the two head-down kneeling guards backed step after step, the youngster named Oroi widely opened the eyes and shouted.

"Kirito....knows, me knows! White ium who played irritating insects collection contest with Uboli and won!"

── Ronye was amazed to the deep of her heart with what he was doing, but of course she did not let it to reflect on her face. Kirito said to that nodding gracefully.

"I still keep properly the medal of Centurion I got at that time. Well, Oroi, from now on, I’ll listen to your stories in order, first from these guards, then from you. Since I will not punish by just their content, please calm down and tell me only the things that have happened."

***

The guard captain who stood up as requested by Kirito said with a face reflecting both anger and awe, as follows.

── Today at around 11:30 am, a report from the citizen came to the guards central office of South Centoria on 4th Avenue, "The fellow is ramping with knives in Karoo street inn". We advanced immediately, and on the second floor in the corridor of the inn, the goblin stood with blooded dagger and a man in the back room was bleeding. The man was a cleaner at the inn, his heart was stabbed, and by that moment his life completely depleted. Judging from the situation we decided that the goblin killed a man with the dagger, instantly took him over to the office and started interrogating ──.

In contrast, the mountain goblin Oroi explained as follows.

── Oroi, with five young people of the same family, came to Centoria on sightseeing trip three days ago. Fellows went to the town after breakfast, but Oroi was sick and was sleeping in the inn's room. Someone knocked the door late morning, when he got out, there were no shadows, but a dagger was falling in the hallway. He picked it up and realized that blood was on it, he was looking at it for some time, then a guard came up from the stairs and he was caught before he knew what was going on.

***

"...... Me, do not do anything ....... Wonder what happened, just  look..."

As soon as Oroi concluded that story, the captain shouted impatiently.

"Well, I guess you had to say so! That dagger is not from the human world! The only ones who use such a bad casting are sub-humans!"

"Diff, different! That sword, it looks alike but is different! Goblin sword, it contains the emblem of the clan in the pommel! That sword does not, it is a fake!"

When Oroi refuted screechingly, the captain tried to respond again. Kirito stopped him with his right hand raised and said.

"It will be known if we investigate. Captain, where’s the dagger now?"

"...... is kept in the weapon store on the first floor."

"Sorry, will not you show it to me?"

Then the captain looked to his subordinate. A young guard officer rushed out as if he had been chased but kept them waiting for nearly five minutes before reporting back with pale face and no dagger.

"…………There is none"

"What, what you say!"

The captain, who yelled loudly, shrunk his neck to the limit and the guard repeated.

"So, the dagger in question cannot be found in the armor store anymore."

***

Two hours later.

Kirito gathered key members of the Human World Union Council in the Central Cathedral — this time it was a coach — and explained the situation. Ronye who accompanied him to the guards office was also allowed to attend a round table as a special case.

It was the Vice-Prime Asuna who first broke the silence spread in the vast space of the main conference hall on the fifteenth floor.

"...... Where is that mountain Goblin, Oroi-san?"

"Oh, I brought him here from the guards building and he’s asked to occupy the vacant room on the fourth floor for the time being, we keep the door guarded, but it is virtually impossible..."

To frowning Kirito, Asuna responded with similar depressed look.

"Until the incident is settled, that is also unavoidable...."

And from the other side of the round table, the knight Dusolbert’s faint voice echoed.

"Apparently both of you seem to be sure that goblin actually did not commit a murder?"

"── Aha, I think so."

Kirito nodded and continued quietly after putting fingers of both hands combined together on the desk.

"The sightseeing trips from the Dark Territory to the Human World is what the Union Council is doing as an exchange project between the two worlds. When crossing "The great Eastern Gate", visitors are obliged to acknowledge the prohibition list. It is a simple rule collection, ban on murder, stealing and injury, but the name of the Dark Army commander is clearly stated in it. In other words, if Oroi who is supposed to be bound by the "Law of the Strongest" of the Dark Territory broke the prohibition and killed the inn cleaner..."

"His right eye has to be bursting."

It was the knight chief Fanatio who finished his phrase.

A lot of people sitting at the round table silently nodded to these words.

For every one living in the Underworld, whether it was a human or a sub-human, there was a technique called "CODE 871". It was a terrible thing that caused a fierce pain to occurs in the right eye when trying to overcome any laws and regulations resulting in the eyeball blowing away without any trace of actually taking damage.

In the first place, ordinary people did not even have the idea of violating the law. Ronye herself faced the unreasonableness of "Taboo Index" once and many times of "Imperial Fundamental Law", but never tried to break them. Of those holding such thoughts or actions and had reached the stage where the right eye is actually destroyed, there were only three confirmed people in the entire three hundred years history of Underworld — well, four people if you add someone who pulled out the right eye themselves — and only them.

And there was nothing wrong with both eyes of mountain Goblin youth Oroi. Ronye saw that with his own eyes.

"……however."

The cautious voice belonged to the Integrity Knight Renri.

Tiese’s groom, the young knight, who waited for an opportunity to reply, whatever caused it, was sitting with completely depressed expression and any color has left his face.

"The murder act should also be the greatest violation for all humans not only that Oroi. It’s us Integrity Knights who is given the right to ultimately ignore most laws, but even we are not able to deal a total loss of the innocent human's life. That means... if anyone other than Oroi killed the inn cleaner, that person......."

"── would have broken the seal of the right eye"

Kirito muttered with a bitter smile on his face.

"Ironically, if we had the "automated elders’ council" that once existed, we’d able to detect the culprit in a moment."

Asuna immediately shook her head.

"No, I’d never rely on such an inhumane system."

Automated Elders’ Council, the predecessor of the Human World Union Council, was operated by the Axiom Church and consisted of a dozen of high-level clerics with frozen life and self-consciousness that permanently performed a remote search for persons who disobeyed the law, in other words, it was a human monitoring device. After the war, the sacred art that had bound the "elders" was canceled, but they gave up the ghosts after sleeping for several days without returning to consciousness.

Having remembered that, Kirito answered exhaling a heavy breath.

"Aha, I get that... Anyway, I’m rather bothered with the strangeness."

"What do you mean?"

Black eyes aimed the questioning Fanatio.

"How should I explain...? In the past all three people who broke the seal of the right eye did not do so just to kill someone. The intense will to resist ultimately unacceptable situation helped them. When it comes to the point of view of, let’s say, the criminal, the victim then is perceived as...... the absolute symbol of evil that must be destroyed at all costs."

Kirito continued looking through documents on the table.

"But, the killed cleaner named Yazen is a figure not likely to cause anyone's resentment in the investigated range. For many years he grew wheat in his aristocrat’s private territory, then worked at an inn since being released last year, and it seems that customers from the Dark Territory received kind treatment without any sign of discrimination. Even that Oroi we captured, this says that Yazen was quite familiar with him."

"In other words, in case of Yazen-san it was impossible for anyone...... to exercise unreasonable power, right?

Kirito energetically nodded to Asuna’s question.

"Not even close... and also there’s the case of missing weapon..."

After the dagger which, based on the report, was apparently used for the murder of Yazen disappeared from the armor store in the dungeon of the guards’ office building, Kirito immediately gathered all the guards in the office and queried directly in the name of the Human World Union Council. But there was no one, who nominated to take it. It would be impossible for a human guard to resist the command of the representative of the Union Council which further directs the Human Word army to which Guard Service belongs. In other words, turns out that the dagger in question was brought from the inn, then stored in the armor store, and then stolen by something external —— or disappeared by itself.

"What is your opinion on this subject?"

When Kirito looked across the round table and asked so, Dusolbert said at once.

"As you said, it was a crude weapon of poor quality, almost ran out of life in a single use, and completely lost it during storage...... couldn’t that be the case?"

"No..... If it is a metal weapon, it wouldn’t be completely annihilated immediately, I feel like there would be some metal scrap left for a while..."

"Hmm...... certainly"

Suddenly an idea came to Ronye's mind as she watched the giant folded his arms with a groan.

She quickly gazed left and right sides of the round table to make sure that no one is going to speak and shyly raised her hand.

"O, Ronye, please?"

"So...... yes. Um ... instructor, no, Dusolbert-sama, if the arrows prepared for the quiver are exhausted, will you replenish with a sacred art?"

When asked, the archer confidently nodded.

"Well, the priority will be much lower than of an arrow made from genuine steel"

"Perhaps, it’s same thing here..... The dagger criminal used, was a "temporary weapon" created with a metallic element...... like that......"

The idea Ronye pointed out has led to a moment of silence in the main conference hall.

It was Kirito's motion, not voice, that broke it. He casually extended the right hand over the table, narrowed eyes.

Although he omitted even the starting phrase of the sacred art to generate metallic element, three glowing silver light spots appeared under his palm. They quickly melted into one and started to change its shape, glittering. One end curved and thickened, the other side became sharp and elongated.

It was a single-edged dagger that Goblin tribe preferred, which Ronnie saw many times, dropping down to the round table making a distinctive sound. The thick blade and the roughly scraped handle were full of small details crafted with exceptional attention — but still, there were some differences seen compared to the real one.

First, the texture of the surface was too smooth. Besides, the handle of a real one should be wrapped with dyed leather, and here it was made entirely of metal, same piece with the blade. Should one take a closer look, it was obvious that it was a metallic element-crafted substitute.

Kirito picked up the dagger he made and said.

"Although I’m closely familiar with Goblin tribes’ daggers, this degree of detail is the limit, but the weapon in question was so precise that even Oroi thought of it as genuine. That would mean that it took a number of high-level clerics plenty of time to generate it."

A faint metal sound “**ki~n**” overlapped the end of his words. Kirito hit a dagger with a light incarnation. It was enough for "temporary weapon" to lose its entire life, it crumbled into pieces like a glass, scattered as grain over the table and disappeared. There was no single piece left after it.

"...... If so, we’ve got a serious problem."

Knight commander Fanatio whispered rocking her wavy black hair.

"Currently, all high-level clerics of Centoria are supposed to be under the command of Human World Army or...... or this unity conference. So, it’s either we’ve got rebels among our staff or…"

── Dark Territory's sacred art master work?

Everyone immediately understood words that were omitted.

If a dark arts master intruded Centoria and killed an innocent civilian for the purpose of some plot, it is many times worse scenario than if the goblin Oroi murdered Yazen by sudden impulse. If so, the exchange project of tourism to the Human World and commerce with the Dark Territory can cause another war between the two worlds that are finally coming down.

"But... ... it that’s true, what’s the purpose...?"

Kirito started muttering something, but immediately he shook his head and said it aloud.

"Everything is still just speculation. At the same time, we need to minimize the impact of this case on citizens. Even though rumors can be prevented from spreading so far, it will be absolutely impossible to prevent them should the second and third cases happen... Asuna, human force army?"

The questioned Vice-Prime quickly nodded.

"I have asked Lina...... I mean, General Selrut to refrain from maintaining security activities other than regular missions. General gave her consent to accept it...... But still there seem to be strong rumors regarding the binding between all travelers from the Dark Territory and the faction of former great aristocracy. It will be suppressed for a while because we have issued an order form the name of the Union Council...."

Asuna interrupted, but strong light filled her hazel eyes.

"... But, if the same incident happens again, the order will bring overwhelming dissatisfaction and distrust of the Union Council. And if I am perceived as a mastermind manipulating this incident from the shadow, I will definitely be seen as causing the next one."

"Aha, so will I, too."

Kirito sighed and gently stroked his hands in a closing gesture.

"── Then, the summary of this Union Council meeting is as follows. First, officially announce that the criminal of the incident is not identified. Second, provide sufficient explanation and compensation for Yasen's bereaved family. Third, investigate the incident with maximum possible mobilization. Fourth...... we will consult as soon as possible with the leaders of the Dark Territory. Any other notes?"

Fanatio immediately raised her hand and pointed out with embarrassment in a voice.

"Even if we ask for...... soonest possible time-frame, it's still a month before the next meeting with the Dark Territory, are you going to move the schedule sooner?"

"Nope"

Kirito suddenly shook his head and said quite casually.

"I will go to Obsidia and meet Isukan."

***

When the meeting was over, Solus was already disappearing over the western horizon.

Ronnie rushed to the dragon stables to the west of Cathedral and waved cheerfully to Tiese was taking care of Tsukigaki.

"I'm sorry, I got late!"

Having heard that voice, a young pale-yellow dragon raised his face quickly from the grassland, sang “**kururu**” and came running up. Holding the fluffy body and scratching beneath his chin, Ronye said to Tiese.

"Thank you, Tiese. Of course, I owe you one."

"You’re talking more and more like Kirito-senpai."

Her redheaded friend, stood by for a while turning her head around, then asked changing her expression.

"So... how was the meeting?"

Sitting on a bench placed along the walls of the stable, Ronnie told her the summary of extraordinary meeting.

Tiese finished listening with a difficult face and eventually muttered.

"Somehow .... I have a bad feeling..."

"Well... in Human World a person cannot kill other person, at least it seems that is what knights thought…"

"There are some people who make use of gaps in laws and regulations and twist them conveniently..."

Indeed, during the "Rebellion of Four Empires", Emperors reigning those days issued edicts decreeing that the newly organized Human World Council was an army of rebels to the old Axiom Church. The binding force of the twisted law was intense, so in order to suppress the mobilizing armies of four empires of Norlangarth, Wesdarath, Eastabarieth and Southacroith, there was no other way but to discard the edict. To reach this, Ronye and Tiese intruded into the Imperial Palace of Northern Centoria, and in the course of events had to cross swords with the emperor Kruger Norlangarth VI himself, who shocked them by demonstrating selfishness so endless and strong it was unclear how it fits into a living human.

Tiese relaxed her arms she unintentionally hugged herself with and told Ronye switching the tone.

"Well, if that is the way things go, I will have to take care of Tsukigaki a little more."

"Huh? Why?"

When Ronye looked back at her face, her best friend smiled and said something completely unthinkable.

"Because, I mean, will you not? Go with Kirito-senpai, to Obsidia."

## Footnotes:

1. <a name="Prim1"></a>“Hold right there” would be more appropriate localized version, but that’s how original reads, plus this is the reason for Ronye’s next phrase.
2. <a name="Prim2"></a>The goblin says “me” as オイラ (“oira”), which can be a version of properly-written “oira” - おいら - so it should be probably male. However, in this line, the guard uses め (“me”) which can be a female pronoun or maybe a shortening of てめえ (“temee”). In other words, I’m totally confused with the gender of the goblin. I’ll treat it as a male for now.
