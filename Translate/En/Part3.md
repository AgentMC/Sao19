# Part 3

Ronye kept thinking over Kirito's words all the time after an unexpected tea ceremony finished and even after she returned dishes to the kitchen.

Neither over a story about the other side of the end wall of the world nor the fact that the world is spherical nor regarding traveling to the moon. She was rather thinking about the topic that first popped up, a possibility of a “new war”.

Ronye also thought that the wealth of the Human World will certainly continue to accumulate dissatisfaction among sub-people. However, actual war – the one that comes as an armed invasion, — to be honest it was hard to believe in this.

_As now the "Peace Treaty of the Five Peoples"<sup><a href="#Prim1">1</a></sup> was concluded with the Dark Territory which should be clearly known to all races. Although it is a primitive law compared to ones of Human World, there was a prohibition of both killing and properly plundering there.  
Of course, for the people of the Dark Territory who for hundreds of years have followed only "the law of the strongest" by which strong people ruled over everyone else, it was impossible to undergo such a major revolution of the scale of heavens and earth exchanging, so as a shock absorber for that period, there was declared a freedom of battle in the range that does not deprive life. However, if it comes to war, there is no way to follow that.  
And, even the people of the Dark Territory, were bearing the soul seal saying “One cannot break the law” just like people of the Human World.  
That is why although it was only a few years since the previous war, it was possible to accept visitors from the Dark Territory in the Human World......._

"... Ronye, hey, are you listening, Ronye?"

Been nudged several times into right shoulder, Ronye raised a startled face.

it seems, while she was working hard on incarnation training in a corner of the large training ground on the fourth floor of the Cathedral, she had unnoticeably sunk in thoughts.

Today's training was "Tanza<sup><a href="#Prim2">2</a></sup> mind wiping", which was much easier-to-comprehend alternative to "Controlling the created element" and "Standing straight on the top of a pillar".

But apparently to her friend sitting next to her, the challenge was to have a chat rather than idle thoughts.

Ronye glanced to a teacher explaining sword skills to junior knights in the center of the training ground — today it was "Conflagrant Flame Bow" Dusolbert — and after watching him for a moment, she apologized to her best friend in a low voice.

"Sorry, I was drowsing."

Having apologized she realized that something unusual was in this situation, as her redhead friend whispered with puffy cheeks.

"What, you didn’t listen at all? ...I told you I need to consult you."

"Consult?"

Tilting her neck slightly, Ronye looked at her with a questioning expression.

Tiese Shtolienen, knight apprentice being her friend since the Sword Mastery Academy, changed her expression to a serious one and nodded.

"Well............... thing is, I....... I was offered…"

"A… competition? Please decline, duels are unsafe!"

When she reflexively exclaimed in a low voice, Tiese’s autumn leaves-colored eyes starred at Ronye, and she quickly denied.

"Not at all! It’s the opposite...... It is not a duel...... It's rather…… matchmaking..."

Companions clearly did not understand what each one was talking about, so Ronye starred at her with a blank look for a few seconds, when she finally understood the meaning of the word.

Immediately after, Ronye had to rely on all her willpower to hold the wild "Ee~~~~e!". Instead, she took a deep breath, held it for a second and slowly breathed out.

After pulling the air in again, Ronye asked fearfully.

"... That......in other words...... means... a marriage....?"

To that, Tiese lowered her gaze to the floor in front of her and gave a short nod.

Ronye held the question of who made the proposal, which was naturally ready to jump out of her mouth. That time there was only one male who might propose the marriage to Tiese. It was senior integrity knight "Twin Edged Wings" Renri Synthesis Twenty-Seven.

It was obvious from the time of the Foreign world war that he has feelings to Tiese. It could be said that it was rather late proposal than surprising one.

Ronye was about to say "congratulations" imaging the figure of a young male knight who always keeps a light smile.

However, still looking downwards Tiese quickly shook her head.

"...... I still have not decided what to reply"

To that whisper, she blinked several times, surprised.

"Well ... why ...? You don’t dislike Renri-sama, it seems to me you like him? And you are together for quite some time......."

As she heard this direct question, Tiese’s face grew even darker and a sad expression appeared on it that was unimpeachably unthinkable to this energetic girl.

"I like him. But you know, the main reason why I do. That is......, how Renri-sama somewhat resembles senpai."

"............!"

Ronye sharply breathed in.

"Senpai" of Tiese was not the Prime Swordsman Kirito, of course. While being a junior trainee at Sword Mastery Academy, just like Ronye was serving Kirito, Tiese has also been attached to an Elite Swordsman trainee. Regardless of his calm demeanor and a meek smile, he had a strong will and sword power enough not to lose to Kirito, and Ronye knew that Tiese had sincere feelings to him.

But he has left this world.

Ronye believed that her redheaded best friend overcame that sorrow. Hoped, that she saved precious memories like jewels deeply in the heart and began walking forward again.

But a transparent drop spilled from red eyelashes to the cheek told her that she was wrong.

"Tiese......."

Ronye called her best friend and tightly covered her lips with palms, then unintentionally stood up. She shouted out to Dusolbert who was actively giving out instructions in the center of the training ground.

"Your Excellency instructor! Knight trainee Shtolienen feels sick, please let us leave today's practice before the end!"

Short-haired knight threw a steel arrow-like gaze in their direction but fortunately just silently nodded.

She quickly helped Tiese to stand up and bow so that they couldn’t see her face, and then they left.

Ronye held shoulders of Tiese as they quickly descended the wide staircase and went to a rose garden spreading in the backyard of Cathedral. They skirted the giant gardener that formerly was a prison guard and went through the labyrinth of passageways and sat down on a small bench they found deep inside.

It was February, so even the earliest varieties of this so rose garden haven’t produced completed buds, and only the vines with small leaves and thorns were trembling in the cold wind.

Tiese was looking through them not trying to focus her wet autumn leaves-colored eyes, and then eventually she murmured.

"............. If I stay with Renri, I believed someday I could forget him...... no, I was hoping so."

"Tiese............"

Gently striking her back, Ronye felt as power left Tiese’s body and her head came to rest at Ronye's shoulder.

"But you know……, in Renri’s smile, and his words, and his gestures, I search all the time for something similar to senpai....... Renri also knows that I couldn’t forget senpai. He said even this is fine. Then he proposed to me. I'm really happy...., I'm happy but ..."

Again, tears ran the long eyelashes and fell. This time they did not stop at a chin, heavy drops fell below and left two stains on simple training clothes.

"I am happy but I don’t really want to forget him. Deep inside my heart I know I want the memories of senpai to stay with me forever. Because it understood it....... that I……"

Breathing heavily with a trembling throat, Tiese pushed her face tightly against Ronye's chest and shouted.

"I want to see him... I want to meet Yujio senpai again..."!

Ronye strongly hugged the back of her close friend who didn’t rise the face and her whole body was shaking from crying.

Even eyes of Ronye filled with hot liquid.

It was only about one month that they two served as valets at the Sword Mastery Academy. But for them, that encounter defined their destiny. It was a miracle that happens only once in a lifetime.

They accepted the miracle and vowed long ago to love no one else forever.

That's why, Ronye finally understood, she selfishly thought that Tiese sought the next happiness — but it actually was a wish that couldn’t be helped.

Because, unlike Ronye, Tiese could not meet that person anymore. Not touching or talking, even gazing secretly from a distance was not possible for her.

Ronye did not have a word of comfort to give her miserable best friend. Instead, she kept tapping her back and stroking her hair.

***

Tiese’s tears finally ceased when the color of the evening sneaked into the rose garden.

As if all the emotions were throttled out, her red-haired close friend leaned her head down to Ronye’s shoulder and looked up at the sinking Solus in a blurry look.

"............ Sorry. And thank you"

Eventually muttered Tiese with a weak voice, but Ronye slightly shook her head.

"No...... It’s me who is sorry, Tiese. I ... ... did not notice your feelings at all, I had selfishly thought you wanted to be happy with Renri"

"That’s OK, I feel like I’ll be happy with that in a little while."

Tiese breathed heavily and said with a strong voice.

"I will ask Renri to wait a little more. Even after some time, nothing may change, but ... but, I have a premonition."

"Premonition ...?"

"Yeah, I feel that since I saw the “machine dragon” Kirito made, ... something will happen from now on, something will change"

Ronye was suddenly reminded of that moment by the words of Tiese. The dark-blue sky behind, the silver light flowing everywhere. She felt a painful elevation from that vision. Surely there was something in that sight portending a huge change.

"... ............ Yes, I feel, too."

When Ronye muttered that, Tiese slowly nodded.

Two girls kept sitting on a bench for a while. In a few minutes, when they heard five o’clock bell, Tiese turned around, took a glimpse of Ronye and told her something unexpected.

"So, what about Ronye?"

"Er... what do you mean?"

The autumn leaves-colored eyes blinked, even a gentle smile appeared ──

"Did you tell Kirito a little about your feelings?"

"No...... No way, such a thing!"

She shouted unintentionally, shrugged and shook her head vigorously.

"I will never do that...... It’s just impossible. I’m fine, don’t worry."

"You were worried about me so can I not be doing the same?"

But she continued to deny in reply to Tiese’s serious question.

"It's not like that, it's all fine...... Senpai has Asuna-sama. Besides, there’s Alice-sama who is supposed to return to this world someday, then Human World Defense Army general Selrut...... Perhaps, Fanatio-sama..."

"So much Ronye"

Sighed Tiese, amazed.

"Kirito-senpai is not married to anyone of them, and now senpai’s status is higher than an emperor, so if you look to the Empire's Fundamental Law, he could have... ... three wives? Four perhaps?

![Image](/Translate/Img/p073.jpg)

"No way, senpai will not do that!"

Ronye shouted again and got up abruptly to hide her red face.

"I’m completely fine! Tiese, take care of yourself first!"

Proclaimed she facing away.

Upon hearing that, her best friend once again sighed, raised from the bench and stood up next to her.

"Well, Kirito-senpai is not likely to say such a thing himself for the time being............. Let’s go back Ronye. Shimosaki is hungry."

"Yeah... I was just about to say so...."

Then Ronye looked at the same hedges on the left and right and said.

"......... Tiese, do you know the way home?"

"...... I was crying, I don’t remember anything."

They looked at each other’s faces and sighed again standing in the deeps of the huge rose labyrinth.

***

That night.

Lying on a bed in her room on the 22nd floor of the Cathedral, Ronye could not easily fall asleep.

_── That’s all because of strange things Tiese said._

And she immediately felt the displeasure towards the girl in the room next door, separated from her by a thick stone wall. But quickly, she reflected on that she probably is having a sleepless night as well.

Anyhow, a man proposed to Tiese for the first time in her life that day.

_── Which place in Cathedral did it happen? What kind of words did he choose?_

Her imagination immediately wandered in a wrong direction.

_── If, hypothetically ... If by any chance Kirito-senpai would propose me. What kind of place will he pick for that? Cathedral’s 95th Floor "Watchtower of the Morning Star"... Or maybe the backyard of a memorable Sword Academy... No, maybe in the clouds above, using a flying technique......_

Ronye sighed heavily, then slapped her cheeks and shielded this thought.

_I must tell myself that even imagining such things should never be done. There is only one thing I can hope for. That peaceful days will continue from now on. Nothing else can be desired. Nothing._

She turned over, dropped her head into a pillow, her fighting sleep spirit finally gave up and Ronye's eyelids have slowly closed.
