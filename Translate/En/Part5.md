# Part 5

The distance from Human World capital Centoria to Dark Territory capital Obsidia was about three thousand kilolu.

This is three days even by dragon that can fly a thousand kilolu a day. One month in the horse-drawn carriage, double that if walking. During the former Foreign World War, Emperor Vector, the commander of the Dark Army, moved 50000 troops from Obsidia to the Great Eastern Gate in five days using the dark art masters’ secret elixir and technique, which later was proved to be a terrible matter that permanently decreased the maximum value of life for every sub-human who drank it. Humans did not take elixir because they used horses or horse-drawn carriages, but sub-people who were walking were till that days in a state of reduced life, and Cathedral clerics were striving to find curation methods.

_Human World Prime Swordsman Kirito who quickly decided to visit Obsidia in response to this emergency situation, of course, would use a flying dragon, Ronye thought. The aerial element flight technique used to travel from Cathedral to the guards’ office in South Centoria consumes a lot of space sacred power, so it cannot be used for a long time in Dark Territory with low amount of resources.  
But he does not have his own mount, so he needs to ride Dusolbert’s or Renri’s dragons. With a two-person ride, a dragon will be exhausted even faster, so I cannot ask to take me with him_ ─ and Ronye had given it up even before being instigated by Tiese.

However, willing at least to help with preparations for the trip, Ronye went from Flying Dragon Stables to the 30th floor of Cathedral where Prime Swordsman's room was. Asuna greeted her and said that "Kirito-kun is in the arsenal" with a face expressing the mix of concerns and acceptance.

Sharing worried of Vice-Prime Swordsman, she had to run a long distance again, down and behind Cathedral ── to the place where there was a former prison ── and upon getting there and moving down the wide ramp, she looked inside through a left open huge door.

Inside was a large space that seemed to be about thirty mel deep and on the left and right sides there were five or six young blacksmiths and clerics filling the space with powerful sound of hammering and swishing. And in the center, there was a huge artifact illuminated by countless light element chandeliers.

It was a "machine dragon", a metal dragon similar to Prototype 1, which had a big explosion the other day, and by its side chief of engineering master Sadore and Kirito were actively exchanging opinions...... strictly speaking, just yelling at each other.

"So, how many times should you say it, Kiri-boy! This baby is still in the process of adjustment, full force flight is impossible, even blockhead like you should be able to understand it!"

"Relax, master, this time I will only fly horizontally instead of vertical launch. Just replace those with wider wings so it can glide the air!"

"What the monkey is going on? So that’s what you say, the destination of my baby is the capital of the Dark Territory! No, we haven’t run flight tests yet, but suddenly I’m acknowledged there is someone who will fly it 6000 kilolu round-trip!"

"But it’s fine, this time thermal-element sealed container’s density is double the one of Version 1, and also master has carefully improved the fuselage. Even if I fly ten thousand kilolu, it won’t blow up. Don’t you think so?"

"Well, that's the case, this one you won’t break so easy, the level of fragility... No, no! Forget what I said. Every time I accept that kind of wheedling from your mouth, it is getting more troublesome than getting my ass stung by Oonumaab<sup><a href="#Prim1">1</a></sup>!"

Having heard their arguing, Ronye felt blood left her face. Kirito will neither use a dragon nor a coach, he intends to fly to Obsidia with this Machine Dragon v. 2. The recent catastrophe vividly revived in her mind, so she swayed her head and rushed towards those two.

"It’s dangerous, Kirito-senpai! As chief engineer Sadore says, what would you do if something happens!"

"Oh, hey, Ronye, don’t get closer or you’ll have oil on your clothes"

Pulling Ronye's left arm away from the dragon for about 50 cen, Kirito laughed gently but then tightened his expression.

"Well, in these circumstances including the you-know-what thing, I have to, regrettably, fly by my own means. Because all the knights are busy and I cannot order anyone of them to get me to Obsidia, and if it is a horse it will take months.... The situation seems to be tenser than we thought, if we do not warn the Dark Territory regarding the situation as soon as possible, it may be too late..."

"............ But, there are other dangers, senpai."

Ronye tried to persuade Kirito hard approaching one step closer.

"The one who killed the inn cleaner Yazen-san and tried to put the crime to the mountain goblin Oroi was not bound by a Taboo Index. Then, they may also target Kirito leaving Centoria...... No, perhaps, this event itself might be a trap to compel senpai to go to Obsidia!"

"Oh...... Indeed, there is a possibility of that..."

When she muttered this with a serious look, Kirito closed his mouth to think about something.

What broke the silence was a loud sigh of master Sadore.

"……so, me too, you know, exchanged a great deal of skills and knowledge blacksmiths from the Dark Territory. These days the world is like in a dream, and I don’t want to go back to old days."

"Hey...... Even such an old man as master, do you still have to learn anything?"

To the question of Kirito, Sadore made a frowning face squeezing his gray beard.

"Unfortunately, yes. The swords and armor of Dark Knights the Defense Army brought back from the battlefield, it was wonderfully crafted. To start with they have used original steel, type of which is unknown to me... Until now we don’t know the source of ore and the manufacturing method."

Sadore hit the outer plate of the silver-shining machine dragon with a big hand covered with countless scars and said.

"...... Kiri-boy, the thermal elements pressure meter says we’re up to 80%. And make sure to set small output opening."

"Oh, that’s truly master! The pressure is...... That's right,...... one kilome per one square cen."

"Wait a moment, please!"

Ronnie hurriedly broken in the conversation between them.

"Aside from the safety of the dragon, there is still the danger of senpai being targeted! To go alone to the Dark Territory, it is pretty much..."

As she was saying that, Ronye looked up at the head of the dragon and noticed something that made her suddenly close mouth.

The glass part surrounding the metal chair — what seems to be called "the cockpit" — was quite longer than the one of Version 1. Staring eagerly, she saw another chair attached to the back of the cockpit.

"............ hey, senpai."

"...What is it?"

"Can this Version 2 possibly ride two people?"

"Um... err, well. Although the supply of cryogenic element for Version 1 wasn’t catching up and it had exploded, which was expected to some extent...... here it's supposed that two people will be able to generate enough cryogenic elements, but as I said earlier, the cooling power is enough to fly horizontally even with one person......."

Ronye interrupted that twisting more and more away explanation of Kirito, who probably felt some bad premonition, with a cough.

"I understood, senpai, to deal with the danger of assassination, suggesting to take an escort."

"You as an escort?"

"Well, as senpai said earlier, everyone among higher-rank knights is busy, so as a knight trainee, I will fulfill this mission responsibly!"

"Er… err?"

"Besides that, I can also help you monitor thermal element cans!"

"Eeeee~~r!?"

Before the reluctant Kirito says anything, Ronye's right fist hit her chest and left hand laid on the sword’s handle in the official knight salute, declaring an unvoiced command acceptance.

Next to perplexedly blinking Kirito, master Sadore made “**Gahhahha**” and smiled happily.

"I say, you lose, Kiri-boy. Nevertheless, Ronye-jochan<sup><a href="#Prim2">2</a></sup> has become quite resolute."

***

Although somehow Ronye managed to get an attendance permission from Kirito, from there it became serious.

Of course, it was the first time for her to visit Obsidia, the capital of the Dark Territory, but she also had no experience of the situation where she was going to be the Kirito’s only assistant. She had no idea on which exactly preparations should be done, and while she was grooming through a lot of small clothes accessories in her room on the twenty-second floor after returning back from the arsenal ──

Someone knocked the door suddenly, and Ronye who thought it would be Tiese ran to the entrance shouting “Yes!”.

"I’m OK, just lend me a hand to help packing......."

She started like that, but once the door opened, who was standing behind it was not her redhead friend, but a beautiful female swordsman with chestnut hair dropped over a pearl knight outfit.

"Ah ...... Asuna-sama!"

Asuna smiled gently and quickly stopped Ronye who was trying to hurriedly make a formal salute.

"Sorry for taking your time, Ronye-san. There is a place I want you to come over for a moment... "

"...... Yes, wherever you say"

Ronye nodded, exited to corridor and started walking behind Asuna. 

Should it me the Sword Mastery Academy in North Centoria, if a higher ranked student would call her this way, the expected development of the situation would involve surrounded by several students behind the school building saying something like "You are not getting a little rude lately, are you?", but of course such things didn’t happen in the Cathedral.

However, Ronye still felt quite uncomfortable having a one-on-one with Asuna. Even though the other party is a Vice-Prime Swordsman of the Human World Union Council, that was not a reason for her to come to Underworld from different world outside it. The reason was quite personal, such that couldn’t be confided to anyone ──

It was in the middle of the Foreign World War one year and three months ago that Asuna descended into the Underworld.

The Human Army decoy platoon Ronye and Tiese participated which was focused on distracting the Dark Territory army led by Emperor Vector was forced into a situation of complete destruction before it could fulfil the role of decoy. Ronye herself attacked the dark knight who had infiltrated behind the headquarters of the Human World military, but her sword was beaten in a blink of an eye, and she already prepared for death — and then Asuna appeared there.

Floating in the jet-black night sky, Asuna with her pure and radiant appearance, was seen as no one else than Genesis God Stacia, drawn on the murals of the Arabel family house and pictures in the Sword Mastery Academy. Asuna raised a rainbow shining sword and created a huge hole in the ground banishing the dark knight who was about to kill Ronye to the bottom of the earth. Ronye who witnessed that miracle believed without any doubt that Asuna is Stacia God herself.

Later Asuna as well as Kirito ─ and additionally, Emperor Vector and the dark knight Ronye fought ─ turned out to be "real world people". Nevertheless, Ronnie's gratitude and respect never faded at all even after more than a year after the war.

But facing each other alone in such a way made Ronye's heart to throb fast.

That is because Asuna was "someone special to Kirito", which now was clear to anyone. Asuna got down to Underworld because I wanted to help Kirito who lost his consciousness at the time.

Whether they were talking casually at a sunny window, or passing a small vial of salt at a lunch, even when she was scolding the unreasonable Prime Swordsman, Ronye strongly felt that Kirito and Asuna are tied with deep love.

_I never thought of interrupting between the two of them. And should it occur in the future...... that is not so far, probably, that the ritual of their marriage will be carried out, at that time I want to just sincerely bless them.  
But............... but. No matter how much time passes, the day when pain deep in my heart disappears, I feel like is never to come............__

Walking after her, Ronye had sunk so much in thought even during descending the stairs, she nearly walked into the back of Asuna when she had stopped in front.

She managed to avoid a collision and looked around, they were standing by a large armor storehouse on the third floor of Cathedral.

The relief over the massive gates depicting gods Solus and Terraria once stated that only Chief elder, knights’ commander and the Highest Priest herself were allowed to open it. Now anyone could visit if they write their name on the table next to the door, but of course it was not allowed to take the contents out.

Asuna wrote her name with a newly developed ink-filled copper pen on the sheet of "hemp paper", which was recently manufactured in the central capital from snow-white hemp fibers as a substitute for parchment, without hesitation opened the door and went inside. Since it was already the evening, there were no visitors, and the calming darkness welcomed them.

Asuna touched the glass tube beside the entrance and chanted a sacred art.

"System Call, Generate Luminous Element"

Using only one finger she generated ten light sources in the tube and then one wind element.

Under its pressure ten light sources moved in the tight pipe running along the wall and brightly illuminated the entire large armor store.

Just like hemp paper and copper pens, this "light tube" and the light chandelier of the arsenal were also developed by Kirito and Asuna. Unlike torches and oil lanterns, there was no danger of fire and light was also white and stable, however as it is contained in a glass tube, since the light reacts little by little with the glass and disappears, it was necessary for who can use sacred art to regularly supplement those. Although it is possible to completely replace oil lanterns in the Cathedral full of clerics, it seemed still impossible to spread it to entire city of Centoria.

As soon as it was illuminated by as many as 10 lights, the whole armor storehouse glowed brightly, and Ronye who barely entered here breathed lightly.

Many colorful armors were lined up in the area wide as a large training ground of the Sword Mastery Academy, and numerous large and small swords, spears and axes were hung on high walls. There probably were some divine-class weapons awarded to senior Integrity Knights, but it was still impossible for trainee Ronye to distinguish them.

"... as usual, it is a wonderful view"

As Ronnie let out the admiration voice, Asuna nodded.

"It is true. But, even this is quite a few to fulfill the needs of Lina’s, I mean, general Selrut’s Human World Army. It seems Kirito wanted to release the majority and let them to be used equally for the support of Human World and Dark Territory, but it was really opposed by Dusolbert."

"Well, that's a difficult problem, is not it?"

She could only give that sort of an answer, as she felt shivers piercing her shoulders.

The importance of support of the Dark Territory was well understood to Ronye who saw the hungry mountain goblins children by her own eyes. But in her mind, words of Kirito still echoed: 『The war will start once again』.

_Should this ever be the case... I want families and students in the North Centoria, Cathedral knights and clerics and of course Tiese to be absolutely safe, and to guarantee that we should leave these weapons that are valuable assets_, — she thought.

Asuna standing behind her patted Ronye’s shoulder and said with a mischievous look on her face.

"So, hmm.... Integrity Knight trainee Ronnie Arabel, how much is your current weapon control authority?"

"Er, wha…? Why does Asuna-sama asks such a thing..."

"It’s all right, it’s all right."

One looking into the face of the second greatest swordsman in the Human World has to obey. Hey, I did not check it recently, what if it went down.... thinking this way, she drew a sign in the air with her left hand and lightly taped her right hand.
