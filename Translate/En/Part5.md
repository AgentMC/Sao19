# Part 5

The distance from Human World capital Centoria to Dark Territory capital Obsidia was about three thousand kilolu.

This is three days even by dragon that can fly a thousand kilolu a day. One month in the horse-drawn carriage, double that if walking. During the former Foreign World War, Emperor Vector, the commander of the Dark Army, moved 50000 troops from Obsidia to the Great Eastern Gate in five days using the dark art masters’ secret elixir and technique, which later was proved to be a terrible matter that permanently decreased the maximum value of life for every sub-human who drank it. Humans did not take elixir because they used horses or horse-drawn carriages, but sub-people who were walking were till that days in a state of reduced life, and Cathedral clerics were striving to find curation methods.

_Human World Prime Swordsman Kirito who quickly decided to visit Obsidia in response to this emergency situation, of course, would use a flying dragon, Ronye thought. The aerial element flight technique used to travel from Cathedral to the guards’ office in South Centoria consumes a lot of space sacred power, so it cannot be used for a long time in Dark Territory with low amount of resources.  
But he does not have his own mount, so he needs to ride Dusolbert’s or Renri’s dragons. With a two-person ride, a dragon will be exhausted even faster, so I cannot ask to take me with him_ ─ and Ronye had given it up even before being instigated by Tiese.

However, willing at least to help with preparations for the trip, Ronye went from Flying Dragon Stables to the 30th floor of Cathedral where Prime Swordsman's room was. Asuna greeted her and said that "Kirito-kun is in the arsenal" with a face expressing the mix of concerns and acceptance.

Sharing worried of Vice-Prime Swordsman, she had to run a long distance again, down and behind Cathedral ── to the place where there was a former prison ── and upon getting there and moving down the wide ramp, she looked inside through a left open huge door.

Inside was a large space that seemed to be about thirty mel deep and on the left and right sides there were five or six young blacksmiths and clerics filling the space with powerful sound of hammering and swishing. And in the center, there was a huge artifact illuminated by countless light element chandeliers.

It was a "machine dragon", a metal dragon similar to Prototype 1, which had a big explosion the other day, and by its side chief of engineering master Sadore and Kirito were actively exchanging opinions...... strictly speaking, just yelling at each other.

"So, how many times should you say it, Kiri-boy! This baby is still in the process of adjustment, full force flight is impossible, even blockhead like you should be able to understand it!"

"Relax, master, this time I will only fly horizontally instead of vertical launch. Just replace those with wider wings so it can glide the air!"

"What the monkey is going on? So that’s what you say, the destination of my baby is the capital of the Dark Territory! No, we haven’t run flight tests yet, but suddenly I’m acknowledged there is someone who will fly it 6000 kilolu round-trip!"

"But it’s fine, this time thermal-element sealed container’s density is double the one of Version 1, and also master has carefully improved the fuselage. Even if I fly ten thousand kilolu, it won’t blow up. Don’t you think so?"

"Well, that's the case, this one you won’t break so easy, the level of fragility... No, no! Forget what I said. Every time I accept that kind of wheedling from your mouth, it is getting more troublesome than getting my ass stung by Oonumaab<sup><a href="#Prim1">1</a></sup>!"

Having heard their arguing, Ronye felt blood left her face. Kirito will neither use a dragon nor a coach, he intends to fly to Obsidia with this Machine Dragon v. 2. The recent catastrophe vividly revived in her mind, so she swayed her head and rushed towards those two.

"It’s dangerous, Kirito-senpai! As chief engineer Sadore says, what would you do if something happens!"

"Oh, hey, Ronye, don’t get closer or you’ll have oil on your clothes"

Pulling Ronye's left arm away from the dragon for about 50 cen, Kirito laughed gently but then tightened his expression.

"Well, in these circumstances including the you-know-what thing, I have to, regrettably, fly by my own means. Because all the knights are busy and I cannot order anyone of them to get me to Obsidia, and if it is a horse it will take months.... The situation seems to be tenser than we thought, if we do not warn the Dark Territory regarding the situation as soon as possible, it may be too late..."

"............ But, there are other dangers, senpai."

Ronye tried to persuade Kirito hard approaching one step closer.

"The one who killed the inn cleaner Yazen-san and tried to put the crime to the mountain goblin Oroi was not bound by a Taboo Index. Then, they may also target Kirito leaving Centoria...... No, perhaps, this event itself might be a trap to compel senpai to go to Obsidia!"

"Oh...... Indeed, there is a possibility of that..."

When she muttered this with a serious look, Kirito closed his mouth to think about something.

What broke the silence was a loud sigh of master Sadore.

"……so, me too, you know, exchanged a great deal of skills and knowledge blacksmiths from the Dark Territory. These days the world is like in a dream, and I don’t want to go back to old days."

"Hey...... Even such an old man as master, do you still have to learn anything?"

To the question of Kirito, Sadore made a frowning face squeezing his gray beard.

"Unfortunately, yes. The swords and armor of Dark Knights the Defense Army brought back from the battlefield, it was wonderfully crafted. To start with they have used original steel, type of which is unknown to me... Until now we don’t know the source of ore and the manufacturing method."

Sadore hit the outer plate of the silver-shining machine dragon with a big hand covered with countless scars and said.

"...... Kiri-boy, the thermal elements pressure meter says we’re up to 80%. And make sure to set small output opening."

"Oh, that’s truly master! The pressure is...... That's right,...... one kilome per one square cen."

"Wait a moment, please!"

Ronnie hurriedly broken in the conversation between them.

"Aside from the safety of the dragon, there is still the danger of senpai being targeted! To go alone to the Dark Territory, it is pretty much..."

As she was saying that, Ronye looked up at the head of the dragon and noticed something that made her suddenly close mouth.

The glass part surrounding the metal chair — what seems to be called "the cockpit" — was quite longer than the one of Version 1. Staring eagerly, she saw another chair attached to the back of the cockpit.

"............ hey, senpai."

"...What is it?"

"Can this Version 2 possibly ride two people?"

"Um... err, well. Although the supply of cryogenic element for Version 1 wasn’t catching up and it had exploded, which was expected to some extent...... here it's supposed that two people will be able to generate enough cryogenic elements, but as I said earlier, the cooling power is enough to fly horizontally even with one person......."

Ronye interrupted that twisting more and more away explanation of Kirito, who probably felt some bad premonition, with a cough.

"I understood, senpai, to deal with the danger of assassination, suggesting to take an escort."

"You as an escort?"

"Well, as senpai said earlier, everyone among higher-rank knights is busy, so as a knight trainee, I will fulfill this mission responsibly!"

"Er… err?"

"Besides that, I can also help you monitor thermal element cans!"

"Eeeee~~r!?"

Before the reluctant Kirito says anything, Ronye's right fist hit her chest and left hand laid on the sword’s handle in the official knight salute, declaring an unvoiced command acceptance.

Next to perplexedly blinking Kirito, master Sadore made “**Gahhahha**” and smiled happily.

"I say, you lose, Kiri-boy. Nevertheless, Ronye-jochan<sup><a href="#Prim2">2</a></sup> has become quite resolute."

***

Although somehow Ronye managed to get an attendance permission from Kirito, from there it became serious.

Of course, it was the first time for her to visit Obsidia, the capital of the Dark Territory, but she also had no experience of the situation where she was going to be the Kirito’s only assistant. She had no idea on which exactly preparations should be done, and while she was grooming through a lot of small clothes accessories in her room on the twenty-second floor after returning back from the arsenal ──

Someone knocked the door suddenly, and Ronye who thought it would be Tiese ran to the entrance shouting “Yes!”.

"I’m OK, just lend me a hand to help packing......."

She started like that, but once the door opened, who was standing behind it was not her redhead friend, but a beautiful female swordsman with chestnut hair dropped over a pearl knight outfit.

"Ah ...... Asuna-sama!"

Asuna smiled gently and quickly stopped Ronye who was trying to hurriedly make a formal salute.

"Sorry for taking your time, Ronye-san. There is a place I want you to come over for a moment..."

"...... Yes, wherever you say"

Ronye nodded, exited to corridor and started walking behind Asuna. 

Should it me the Sword Mastery Academy in North Centoria, if a higher ranked student would call her this way, the expected development of the situation would involve surrounded by several students behind the school building saying something like "You are not getting a little rude lately, are you?", but of course such things didn’t happen in the Cathedral.

However, Ronye still felt quite uncomfortable having a one-on-one with Asuna. Even though the other party is a Vice-Prime Swordsman of the Human World Union Council, that was not a reason for her to come to Underworld from different world outside it. The reason was quite personal, such that couldn’t be confided to anyone ──

It was in the middle of the Foreign World War one year and three months ago that Asuna descended into the Underworld.

The Human Army decoy platoon Ronye and Tiese participated which was focused on distracting the Dark Territory army led by Emperor Vector was forced into a situation of complete destruction before it could fulfil the role of decoy. Ronye herself attacked the dark knight who had infiltrated behind the headquarters of the Human World military, but her sword was beaten in a blink of an eye, and she already prepared for death — and then Asuna appeared there.

Floating in the jet-black night sky, Asuna with her pure and radiant appearance, was seen as no one else than Genesis God Stacia, drawn on the murals of the Arabel family house and pictures in the Sword Mastery Academy. Asuna raised a rainbow shining sword and created a huge hole in the ground banishing the dark knight who was about to kill Ronye to the bottom of the earth. Ronye who witnessed that miracle believed without any doubt that Asuna is Stacia God herself.

Later Asuna as well as Kirito ─ and additionally, Emperor Vector and the dark knight Ronye fought ─ turned out to be "real world people". Nevertheless, Ronnie's gratitude and respect never faded at all even after more than a year after the war.

But facing each other alone in such a way made Ronye's heart to throb fast.

That is because Asuna was "someone special to Kirito", which now was clear to anyone. Asuna got down to Underworld because I wanted to help Kirito who lost his consciousness at the time.

Whether they were talking casually at a sunny window, or passing a small vial of salt at a lunch, even when she was scolding the unreasonable Prime Swordsman, Ronye strongly felt that Kirito and Asuna are tied with deep love.

_I never thought of interrupting between the two of them. And should it occur in the future...... that is not so far, probably, that the ritual of their marriage will be carried out, at that time I want to just sincerely bless them.  
But............... but. No matter how much time passes, the day when pain deep in my heart disappears, I feel like is never to come............__

Walking after her, Ronye had sunk so much in thought even during descending the stairs, she nearly walked into the back of Asuna when she had stopped in front.

She managed to avoid a collision and looked around, they were standing by a large armor storehouse on the third floor of Cathedral.

The relief over the massive gates depicting gods Solus and Terraria once stated that only Chief elder, knights’ commander and the Highest Priest herself were allowed to open it. Now anyone could visit if they write their name on the table next to the door, but of course it was not allowed to take the contents out.

Asuna wrote her name with a newly developed ink-filled copper pen on the sheet of "hemp paper", which was recently manufactured in the central capital from snow-white hemp fibers as a substitute for parchment, without hesitation opened the door and went inside. Since it was already the evening, there were no visitors, and the calming darkness welcomed them.

Asuna touched the glass tube beside the entrance and chanted a sacred art.

"System Call, Generate Luminous Element"

Using only one finger she generated ten light sources in the tube and then one wind element.

Under its pressure ten light sources moved in the tight pipe running along the wall and brightly illuminated the entire large armor store.

Just like hemp paper and copper pens, this "light tube" and the light chandelier of the arsenal were also developed by Kirito and Asuna. Unlike torches and oil lanterns, there was no danger of fire and light was also white and stable, however as it is contained in a glass tube, since the light reacts little by little with the glass and disappears, it was necessary for who can use sacred art to regularly supplement those. Although it is possible to completely replace oil lanterns in the Cathedral full of clerics, it seemed still impossible to spread it to entire city of Centoria.

As soon as it was illuminated by as many as 10 lights, the whole armor storehouse glowed brightly, and Ronye who barely entered here breathed lightly.

Many colorful armors were lined up in the area wide as a large training ground of the Sword Mastery Academy, and numerous large and small swords, spears and axes were hung on high walls. There probably were some divine-class weapons awarded to senior Integrity Knights, but it was still impossible for trainee Ronye to distinguish them.

"... as usual, it is a wonderful view"

As Ronnie let out the admiration voice, Asuna nodded.

"It is true. But, even this is quite a few to fulfill the needs of Lina’s, I mean, general Selrut’s Human World Army. It seems Kirito wanted to release the majority and let them to be used equally for the support of Human World and Dark Territory, but it was really opposed by Dusolbert."

"Well, that's a difficult problem, is not it?"

She could only give that sort of an answer, as she felt shivers piercing her shoulders.

The importance of support of the Dark Territory was well understood to Ronye who saw the hungry mountain goblins children by her own eyes. But in her mind, words of Kirito still echoed: 『The war will start once again』.

_Should this ever be the case... I want families and students in the North Centoria, Cathedral knights and clerics and of course Tiese to be absolutely safe, and to guarantee that we should leave these weapons that are valuable assets_, — she thought.

Asuna standing behind her patted Ronye’s shoulder and said with a mischievous look on her face.

"So, hmm.... Integrity Knight trainee Ronnie Arabel, how much is your current weapon control authority?"

"Er, wha…? Why does Asuna-sama asks such a thing..."

"It’s all right, it’s all right."

One looking into the face of the second greatest swordsman in the Human World has to obey. Hey, I did not check it recently, what if it went down.... thinking this way, she drew a sign in the air with her left hand and lightly taped her right hand.

"Stacia’s window" appeared with a faint glow, was the representation of the ultimate essence of a person — something Kirito was calling "personal stats" — so was not polite to peep at other’s windows except for the cases of emergency. To protect her window from Asuna’s look, Ronye went one step behind her and then told the number in the row titled **【Object Control Authority】**.

"Err, it is 39<sup><a href="#Prim3">3</a></sup>......"

"Amazing, it's almost the same as numbered knights have."

Asuna smiled sweetly and went to the far wall murmuring "Well then.......". She moved through countless displayed one-handed swords of various colors and designs one after another, chose as much as four and holding them by two in each hand, arranged on a nearby bench.

"These are priorities 38 and 39. Choose whichever you like, Ronye-san."

The unexpected words of Asuna made the other one speechless for several moments.

Speaking of Priority 39, it does not extend to the level of divine objects, but such a sword is still unique and categorized as a legendary one. Indeed, all four lined up on the bench were decorated with a wonderful decoration, and all polished like a mirror blades shined with different shades. Even "Four Oscillation Blades" reporting directly to Fanatio were using official style swords, the knight trainee could not even dream of such a gift.

"I ... could not .... Asuna-sama!"

When Ronnie swung both hands and head at the same time, Asuna grinned and said.

"That gesture, it looks a bit like Kirito-kun"

"Well ... yeah... maybe ... ...."

"He-he, you do not have to hold back, Ronye-san. I got permission from commander Fanatio and above all you are a brave person who fought through that war until the end."

"............... It’s such a..."

Once again, wiggle and waving.

"...... I was protected by Asuna and Renri, and many Human World swordsmen, and swordsmen who came to the rescue from Real World...... When that black knight did terrible things against Kirito-senpai, even though I was there, I could not do anything."

"Not at all, for sure."

Asuna suddenly made a step towards Ronye and gently pit her hands to Ronnie's back. Although at first her body became completely stiff, sweet and refreshing scent of melati<sup><a href="#Prim4">4</a></sup> and gentle warmth quickly melt the tension.

"It was Ronye-san and Tiese-san, and Alice, who protected Kirito when he couldn’t move. For me, you are the true heroes... I won’t ever be able to thank you enough..."

Feeling tears covering her eyes from these words, Ronye muttered.

"Alice-sama...... Why did she leave......."

After a while Asuna responded with certainty.

"She is fine in the real world. She is the hope that ties the two worlds....... I'm sure, someday, we’ll meet again......"

Having applied some strength to both arms hugging Ronye, Asuna released her and smiled again.

"Now, pick a sword, this is not just you, it's also a weapon to protect Kirito-kun."

After such words she couldn’t refrain any longer.

Again, she looked at swords selected by Asuna. All four were straight swords for one hand, but grips and blades are somewhat slender, and it is understood that her selection matched not only the priority but also Ronye’s stature.

As it was discovered recently through steady Kirito’s analysis, top-ranking weapons, accessories and decorative items with priority exceeding 30, in addition to the value of the life displayed in the Stacia’s Window, it seems, were granting certain "hidden natural power", so to speak. It included a wide range of increased absorption of attribution attacks, poison, fatigue, dark arts, or, on the contrary, it could help to generate a specific element, in rare cases, the life recovery speed is increased or one becomes able to see in the night; they said, even strange effects such as being liked by dogs were discovered.

In addition, it turned out that divine objects the deceased Highest Priest Administrator had given to the Integrity Knights, had hidden natural power to strengthen the sacred art of those attribute which one was good at, which means not only weapons but also the capabilities of knights were available to Administrator in much more detailed form than the Stacia's Window. Currently, Cathedral's high-level clerics seem to be doing their best to implement the "sacred techniques to uncover hidden natural power", but it will take a long time... Kirito had said.

Four swords lined up in front of Ronye's eyes should also have different hidden natural powers, but from the appearance it couldn’t be seen at all. She could try using sacred art of all attributes equipping them in turn, or run around the Cathedral and then examine the recovery speed of her life, but this way she will feel faintly, which was not possible to afford as they were departing tomorrow early in the morning.

She felt that a faint voice came back from the depths of her memory when she was standing in the same way without knowing what to choose.

_......In the past, this sword was too heavy, even hard to lift, rather not to swing it._

The one who said that holding a beautiful long sword with a slightly bluish white blade, was the same person whom Tiese served as a valet, elite swordsman-in-training Yujio. Next to him elite swordsman-in-training Kirito smiled polishing his own black sword, and nearby tables had just boiled tea and freshly baked honey pie spreading a nice scent. It has been so long time ago, nearly two years have passed already since that old scene.

At that time Tiese and Ronye were first year students just entered the Northern Centoria’s Sword Mastery Academy. Although it happened so that the results of their entrance exams were good and they were able to get the place among twelve people chosen from one hundred twenty applicants, they still had troubles handling as expected those platinum oak wooden swords of priority 15 they were given, so they asked senpais how to handle heavy swords.

Yujio easily lifted the "Blue Rose sword" that although looking delicate and slim was much heavier than steel made big two-handed swords, and continued.

『In theory, if swordsman’s weapon control authority exceeds the priority of the weapon, the sword will not be too heavy. But I think that the connection between a sword and a swordsman is such a thing that cannot be expressed by numbers only. Even weapons having lower priority than their owner’s authority will not respond to the will of the owner at the time of need if they don’t treat them seriously or do not handle normally. I could not swing this sword a long time ago not only because I did not have enough authority, but because my connection to this sword was not enough... I think that’s the way it is. 』

"Connection...... to the sword"

Hearing such words for the first time, Ronye and Tiese were greatly puzzled.

Both of them were children of the sixth, lowest class aristocracy, and their parents dreamed that their kids will grow up and succeed enough to be granted the forth class so they won’t be living in fear of the aristocratic right of senior aristocrats anymore, so they spare no expense to train their children sword technique. Foremost, if a wooden sword is broken with intense training, they will be happy to take a replacement. For both of them the sword is a dream...... or rather a tool to realize the dreams of their parents, not really their own, and at the same time they were the handcuffs that tied them prescribing their future.

So even if one said that a connection to a sword is essential, they could not understand that immediately.

To such two people, Yujio talked with a gentle smile.

"Not only the sword. Even clothes, shoes, tableware...... every single particle generated by sacred art, if you open your heart and share your love they will surely respond. Maybe, people too."

Then, Kirito who listened last two sentences silently stopped polishing "the sword of the night sky" — at that time simply called "black" ─ and deepened the mischievous smile.

"Yes, Yujio and myself have our minds open. For example, I have a connection to Yujio’s pie, and I hear it happily permits me to eat it."

"I'm sorry, but the moment I eat my pie I will be executing my connection with yours, Kirito."

When listening to that exchange, Ronnie unexpectedly smiled and laughed. Laughing, she felt like she could understand the words of Yujio.

From that day on, with the permission of the dorm guardian those two decided to brush and polish platinum oak wooden swords from the training ground every day to heal the damage caused by training. It did not take a while until they become able to freely swing a wooden sword.

They hoped secretly that those enjoyable days at the Academy would continue forever. But only a month and a half later, Yujio and Kirito attacked other elite swordsmen-in-training with the Sword of the Blue Rose and the Sword of the Night Sky to help Tiese and Ronye and were taken to the Axiom Church. After that, when they escaped from the dungeon, they challenged the Axiom Church itself, breaking through the world's most powerful knights, and finally even defeated the Highest Priest Administrator who was the ruler of the Human World. But in that fight Yujio lost his life and became the one who will never return.

Recalling the voice of Tiese striving to meet Yujio-senpai, Ronye stretched her right hand without touching the tears that appeared once again.

_Swordsman does not choose a sword. It is the sword that picks the owner. Should I open my heart and pour love to them, any sword will surely respond._

Ronnie's hands caught the third from left — a long sword with silver guard and pommel, with handle wrapped with rough black leather resembling Kirito’s hair, emitting a soft sheen. Brand new handle leather was a little hard feeling, but she thought that if she handles it with care it will soon become familiar with her palm.

She breathed in and exhaled, then gently lifted the sword.

Heavy. A heavy feeling of dense and resistant thing strongly transmitted from fingers through her wrist, elbow and shoulder to the core of the body.

_But it was not an unpleasant weight. Just like platinum oak wooden sword I was using as a junior swordsman trainee, just like an official sword of Human World Defense Army we fought through two wars together, I feel like I’ll be able to handle this one freely someday if I take care of it with love._

She grasped the handle with her right hand and felt the essence of the sword by placing a blade on her left, then a gentle voice sounded.

"...... Is this sword OK?"

She firmly nodded to Asuna’s words.

The Vice-Prime Swordsman put all the other three in sheaths, rested on the wall support, and then went around the bench and stood on the left side of Ronye.

"The name for this sword should be assigned by Ronye-san. Go to the administration department once you decide, have them register it in the knight equipment ledger."

"......Yes."

It was the first time she had a sword that must be registered due to its significance, so she was a bit confused but nodded thinking that it is also an obligation of the owner. In the past it was the Highest Priest Administrator’s whimsy to build or destroy divine objects, give it to someone or take it back, but now all kinds of weapons and armor accessories in Cathedral are carefully managed by ledger.

Asuna nodded smiling, glanced at the left side of Ronye’s waist.

"What will you do with that sword? If you wish to return it to the Human World army, I can deliver it to the headquarters with a tomorrow's messenger."

"Oh, ye... yes, I should..."

![Image](/Translate/Img/p115.jpg)

She would involuntarily begin to stammer in response to unexpected words.

The standard sword, which was always on her left hip, was owned by Ronye ── the sacred letter "P" would be shown indicating that she is the owner if she opens the Stacia’s Window ── but in the light of military rules of the Human World Defense Army, it was a loan only. _When we renew our weapons and old ones become redundant we have to return them to the army._

Both handle and sheath were made of dark brown leather, and although its creation involved practically no decoration, it was still a sharp sword of priority 25 made from Crois steel<sup><a href="#Prim5">5</a></sup> which was southern specialty. It by no means was a cheap production, and because Ronye had carefully maintained it, plenty of life was still left.

Actually, it should have been exchanged to the standard sword of the Knights Order a year ago when she was appointed as an Integrity Knight trainee, but at that time she kept postponing it as she was too busy, so eventually both Ronye and Tiese remained attached to their previous sword and kept using it as it was.

However, if a new sword is offered from a Vice-Prime Swordsman in such a way, she had to finally bid it farewell. ── However.

".................."

Holding a new sword with her right hand, she was still gently touching the handle of the standard sword with the left one; Asuna nodded and said.

"I understand that feeling. I also didn’t want to let go my first loved sword, so I annoyed Kirito-kun."

"Er…?"

Surprised, she stared at the face of Vice-Prime.

"Asuna-sama...... is that about Real World...?"

"Well, not exactly. Long ago, Kirito-kun and I were fighting together in a world that is neither a Real World nor an Underworld. To be precise...... Kirito-kun taught me how to fight when I knew nothing at all."

"So even Asuna-sama who is strong like God, had times like that......."

"That's right, I am not a god but same as Ronye-san...... a human girl."

Looking at Asuna's smiling face, which seemed to be more beautiful than any human being is allowed to have, Ronye narrowed her eyes for a moment and asked.

"Em...... Asuna-sama, so how did you make yourself to let go your first sword?"

Asuna looked down at the palm of the right hand as if to miss the sensation of the sword, raised her face and answered.

"With the recommendation of Kirito-kun, I melt the sword... into a metal bar, its original form, and I made a new sword from that material. This way, he said, the soul of the sword will be transferred....... That person, he can be so badly sentimental about swords."

"Hehehe...... It looks very much like Kirito-senpai."

Two people were laughing and giggling for some time, but eventually Asuna murmured "But".

"This story in current circumstances won’t help Ronye-san...... I cannot melt the sword of the human world army, and furthermore, there is already a new sword in the first place..."

"...Well, I could decide after listening to your story. This sword will be returned to the human forces army."

She put the new sword back to the table, removed the standard sword together with the sheath from the clasp on the sword belt and handed it out to Asuna with both hands.

"Is it really okay...? If you ask Rina-san, I think it is also possible to continue to own it......"

"No, it's really fine. I knew this sword is too light for me long ago....... I guess, someone next needs it."

"I understood. Well then, I will return this to the Human Army Headquarters with a messenger tomorrow."

Having received the standard sword with a gesture full of respect, Asuna hung it on the right side of her waist. Although the standard sword of the Human World Army is said to be light, when it is combined with the sacred instrument "Radiant Light" on the left of her waist, it should be a considerable weight, but she returned to the opposite side of the bench with a gait that does not suggest any weight at all and presented a black leather sheath decorated with silverwork that she put there.

Ronye who lowered his head lowered his clasp to the sword belt when he put the sword in it. While feeling new weights throughout the body, Asuna suddenly stretched his spine straight and stared straight at Ronye.

"...Ronye-san. Regarding Kirito-kun, thank you."

"Ah... sure!"

She answered reflexively, but remembering the situation, Ronye returned to the attitude of knight recitation.

"Integrity knight apprentice Ronye Arabel, will protect the Prime Swordsman at the cost of my life!"

After Ronye replied correctly, Asuna smiled.

"Do not discard your life though. It is the best that you both come home safely, if you see Kirito-kun runs away, please escape as well."

Feeling something like a trembling of emotions in her words, Ronye asked still hesitating to lower his hands.

"......Er, really, does Asuna-sama wish to accompany him herself..?"

"Just a little bit"

It was a jokingly answer, but it was clear that the meaning behind her words was different. However, Vice-Prime Swordsman shook her head a little and said even before Ronye opened her mouth to answer.

"Both me and Kirito-kun cannot leave Centoria at the same time now. There are a lot of decisions we have to take every day, and former senior aristocrats’ dissatisfaction with the Human World Union Council is not going to disappear any time soon..."

"....... I’m sorry, it’s such a shame......."

As she reflexively lowered his head, Asuna blinked her eyes and smile to her.

"There’s nothing to apologize, Ronye-san, what is it?"

"You see... I also came from a noble family and I never had any doubts about the aristocracy system of the Human World until I met Kirito-senpai..."

"But fathers of Ronye-san and Tiese-san were doing important work in the guard and the executive branch for a long time, did they not? It is entirely different from great aristocrats enjoying each day thanks to the forced hard labor of people living in their territory."

"............"

Ronye remained silent, keeping her head low feeling a great appreciation.

In the former Imperial Palace rising above the hill not far from Central Cathedral, former Imperial administration and Imperial guards were still operating at that time, so her father worked as a guard platoon leader the same way as before the war. But the Konoe Knights order that was previously present on the imperial guard was completely dismantled<sup><a href="#Prim6">6</a></sup>, the functions of guard offices were mostly transferred to the Human World Defense Army led by General Solterina Selrut. In the future, it seemed, all of the four platoons remaining in four empires will be integrated into the Defense Army and the size of military itself will be reduced. It is natural since the Dark World threat has already passed, but should this happen, Ronye was not sure whether her father will remain in his present position.

If he is ordered to rearrange within the platoon or transfer to an administrative office, her father will continue to fulfill his duties properly. _Even if we lose the enormous amount of income from labor of lenders by the Private Estate Liberation Act and he is going to work in the executive branch or the Human World Army, it will still be different from great aristocrats trying not to serve themselves at any cost......_ so Ronye thought.

But even this way her father, and perhaps Ronye herself, will still feel it in their hearts. Perception that they are noblemen and different from general people. As long as that class mindset passed from generation to generation has not disappeared, both Ronye and people of Arabel family would remain essentially the same as the senior nobility.

"Asuna-sama, better to......"

Ronye managed somehow to interrupt words that were almost out of her mouth.

_Not only the noble grades, it would be better to abolish the aristocratic system itself._

She thought so, but it wasn’t a good thing to say while aiming at the Human World highest rank of Integrity Knight herself. And the wish to become a knight can never be thrown away. Being given the glorious knight number, the silver armor, and the dragon, she would continue to serve Kirito for the rest of her life... because that was the only true dream of Ronye.

Asuna tilted the neck encouraging her to continue, and Ronye answered after shaking her head a little.

"No, it’s nothing...... But uh, if possible, could you let Tiese to get the same sword as this one...? Because she also still continues to use the sword of Human World Army......"

"Yes, I'm going to get permission for Tiese-san as well."

"That’s great, thank you very much."

_If after that Tiese also makes it to the same conclusion......_ thinking this way, Ronye swallowed the words she could not admit herself at all.

***

When two of them came out of the weapon storehouse where the light of luminous elements started to fade already, the 7 PM bell echoed around.

After writing the exit time in the journal, Asuna said that she would go to the general affairs section on the second floor and went down the main stairway. Ronye left alone again looked up at the night sky still shaded light purple through the big window in the front of the armor store and let out a heavy breath.

In the Sword Mastery Academy where she was studying for only half a year, there was a rule that dinner must be finished by 7 PM, and if one was late without a good reason, that day they would be left without dinner. Of course, there was no such rule in Central Cathedral, it was possible to eat hot food at any time until 9 PM while big dining room on the 10th floor is open, and even later snacks are available in the large kitchen next to the dining room.

Today she ran around up and down, so supposedly she should had been hungry because of all those various activities, but somehow, she did not feel like eating that very moment, so Ronye decided to return to her room.

She used to ride an automatic elevator to Cathedral 22nd floor where her room was located, but that day she climbed the main stairs to get used to the weight of the new sword as soon as possible.

Kirito and Yujio, who escaped from the dungeon nearly two years ago, flew this staircase up to the 50th floor fighting Integrity Knights. There were no signs of fierce battle left, except for the feeling of two people being chased at that time, and just like them she moved her legs and eventually arrived to the 22nd floor with a little dyspnea.

A private room on the right side of the corridor a little ahead was still a double room shared with Tiese because of their trainee rank, but here friend was not in the room. She thought that Tiese has probably gone to dinner, and went to her bedroom through a shared living room.

As a coincidence, the living room and two bedrooms structure was exactly the same as the room of the elite swordsman-in-training dormitory where Kirito and Yujio were living, but each room was quite large here. Her room at the parents' house where she spent her childhood until entering the Sword Mastery Academy was about half of these, so Ronye felt too restless because of its size from the very beginning, but in the end, took her time to arrange favorite furniture and restyle it many times, as a result it finally felt comfortable to live.

Looking from the entrance, the wall on the back had a large window facing East Centoria, a bed with linen was on the left and there was a small table on the right. And the wall on the opposite side from the window there was a lighting device like the one in the armor storehouse. She entered the room, removed the sword from the waist and gently placed it by the wall; the black leather sheath fitted well to the interior with many dark brown furniture.

"I’ll think carefully, and will give you a name that suits you."

She whispered to the sword, removed the gray light armor and fixed it quickly on the armor stand on the right side of the sword rest. She would want to throw the body that immediately felt lighter to the bed, but had to endure. In preparation for a long trip from tomorrow, she must pack things well.

From Kirito she learned that the luggage should be one medium-sized bag available to knights, so she had to select things quite carefully. As girl reaching 17 years old that year she would of course like to take as many dresses as possible, but as a guardian of Kirito she knew it was not just a trip, she should give priority to medicines and sacred art media. First of all, she checked the medium at hand and would have to refill missing items with the management department, but before that ──

"............... bath, let’s go..."

Muttering that and having prepared the changing underwear, Ronye left the room.

Bathrooms were located on each floor of a residential area from the 20th to the 30th floor of Cathedral, so both Ronye and Tiese usually bathed there. But occasionally...... especially before leaving Cathedral for long, she would definitely want to go over there.

She walked along the aisle to the elevator area in the northern part of the floor. Aligned the control knob to the mark of 90th floor at the top and pushed the metal button; the aerial element contained in a sealed can at the bottom of the elevator was released as requested, and began to raising Ronye.

After several tens of seconds, the elevator gradually slowed down and eventually locked in, and Ronye opened the metal door.

When she exited there was a short passage divided into the left and right ways ahead. And, before the branch, a pure white cloth hung down from the ceiling with strange text "ゆ"<sup><a href="#Prim7">7</a></sup> written in black with a strange font.

This hanging cloth was attached by the Prime Swordsman Kirito, and it seemed he had written the character himself, but no one knew what it was intended for. They said, Vice-Prime Asuna seemed to be the only one who knew it but remained silent and just laughed with surprised expression.

Tilting her head as she was walking through this passageway, she lifted the cloth with "ゆ" lower half of which was cut into strips, and reached the branch point. More hanging cloths of same design appeared on the left and right.

The blue cloth on the right side had "men" written in white letters. The pink cloth of the left had "women".

The meaning of these signs can be understood with no effort ─ which didn’t help at all with the mystery of “ゆ” ─ so, she went through the cloth with "women". The aisle bent to the right and ended with a little wider room.

The room with a large shelf installed as a partition wall was not empty, three female clerics wearing only thin eastern style kimonos sat on wall chairs wiping wet hair. As they noticed Ronye they hurriedly got up and put hands together.

Women bowed to the level of their waists and greeted her keeping their head down.

"Good evening, knight-sama" "Greetings, knight-sama" "Good evening"

Ronye returned the greeting bowing to the waist as well, and hurried toward the opposite side of the room. When she reached the shade of the shelf, she breathed out. It was not yesterday or the day before yesterday that she was appointed as a knight trainee, but she was still not getting used to such admiring attitude especially from older people of same gender. She couldn’t grasp how to display such a dignified demeanor how knights’ commander Fanatio and even ordered knights do.

Having undressed and put her clothes together with the change she brought into basket inside the shelf, Ronye wrapped white towel around her body and opened the glass door in the back.

White steam immediately started pouting inside so she quickly did a step ahead and closed the door behind her.

The steam dissipated unhiding a scene that she could not stop to adore even though she saw it number of times.

A vast space taking almost half of the 90th floor of the Cathedral. Both the floor and pillars are made of pure white marble, the southern and eastern walls were huge solid pieces of glass, so one could overlook the night view of the central capital Centoria. Even this alone would be a luxury exceeding one of the former Imperial Palace, but the truly amazing thing was the huge amount of hot water filling all the floor surfaces falling down in a staircase pattern.

The length of the elongated hall from north to south was about 40 mel, the width reached 25 mel. The width of the surrounding track was 2 mel, and since the depth from the floor to the bottom of the bath was one mel, simple calculation suggested that total amount of hot water in the bath was equal to 874 cubic mel, and converted to the "lil" which was a unit of the liquid volume, the result would be a huge figure of 874000 lil<sup><a href="#Prim8">8</a></sup>. Moreover, the west side across the marble wall — that is, the one marked with hanging cloth with "men" on it, had completely symmetrical structure, so the total amount of hot water is doubled.

This place was a large public bath that Kirito called "the most luxurious facility in Central Cathedral".

Before the Foreign World War, only thirty Integrity Knights could use it, there was no middle wall, and it seems it was quite often case that only a single person was soaking in this bathtub. However, along with organization restructuring, it was opened to all Cathedral clerics and staff, and at the same time male and female sections were separated.

About twenty people were bathing at that time, but there was no impression that the bathtub wide as a little lake was crowded. Still, she walked to the southeast corner where fewer people were, slowly submerged her toe in transparent water. At first it felt hot, but soon she got used to it, went down the marble staircase and sit on the last step.

Immersing in hot water to the neck brought a feeling of deep relaxation to the core of the head that cannot be enjoyed in a bathtub of common size in the residential area, and she let a breath out.

"Huu............"

"Well, a huge bath is good, is it not?"

"It really is…………"

She nodded, then opened her eyes wide. Someone was sitting on the left completely unnoticed till that moment.

A tear appeared in the steam raising from the hot water, and as soon as that person's face was exposed, Ronye was once again bend backwards, surprised.

Light-brown hair so short that wet ends were sticking to the nape, crisp large light-blue eyes.

The body of one sitting higher than Ronye was a child delicate ─ but behind that appearance suggesting a girl of about ten years old was something by no means as innocent as it looked.

"Good… good evening, Fizel-sama"

The girl flying her fingertips over the water surface reacted the way similar to Ronye herself greeted just now by three clerics in the undressing room.

"There is no need in that “sama”. Ronye is older."

"But...... but Fizel-sama is a numbered knight......."

"Ugh, I feel like I had this dialog for about a hundred times already."

The name of the girl who floated her stretched body on the water surface kicking the water with both feet was Fizel Synthesis Twenty-nine.

During the Foreign World War she had a special titled being "numbered trainee", but after it she soon got publicly promoted and now she was a genuine Integrity Knight. She was given silver armor made according to her physique and a dragon named "Himawari"<sup><a href="#Prim9">9</a></sup> and Recently she was mainly flying around the Human World with intelligence missions.

"Fizel-sama, I haven’t seen you for a while, have you been at a mission again?"

To Ronye's question, Fizel nodded and brought her mouth from under hot water.

"Yeah, the latest movements of the western Emperor’s Konoe Knights’ remnants were somewhat suspicious, so we were sent out explore. Linel is still over there, I have just returned for reporting and picking up some supplies."

"Thank you very much for your hard work...... Ardales Wesdarath V of the Western Empire was the only one of the four emperors we could not find traces of...... Is it related to that?"

"Hmm, the Western Imperial Palace was destroyed and burned out to the ground by Fanatio-onēsama’s memory release technique. I don’t think that the Emperor-ojiichan<sup><a href="#Prim10">10</a></sup> survived that explosion, but there were other people who wanted to save their miserable lives."

It couldn’t be imagined that such words were spoken by a ten-year-old kid blowing bubbles on the water surface, Fizel was certainly not of the age she looked like. Her friend, Integrity Knight Linel Synthesis Twenty-eight, and her were both born within Cathedral, but never received the "Synthesis Ritual"; they said that when the Highest Priest Administrator appointed them as Integrity Knight trainees, for some reason a sacred art had been performed to freeze their life before it had a chance to reach its maximum value. In other words, one couldn’t judge their age from their appearance ─ they simply did not grow any more.

Considering that, even though Ronye for some reason had a wish to tightly hug Fizel & the other one, she would have never done it. Apart from the fact that they were Integrity Knights, to become a numbered trainee they had killed knights who previously took that number; they tried to paralyze Kirito and Yujio with a poisonous sword and take head off their neck; those two got rid of the majority of goblin troops that had invaded the back of the Human World Defense Army at the time of a Foreign World War, — there were a number of horrible rumors. If one speaks directly like this showing not even a glimpse of fear, there is no doubt that she is a kind of person requiring appropriate respect.

"So then, Ronye-chan…"

Unexpectedly her name was called, and Ronye straightened his spine in hot water.

"Ye…yes!"

"I heard that~"

Fizel grinned floating on the water surface.

"…as a companion of Kirito, you go to Obsidia?"

"Err, well, that......."

Kirito and Ronye's route beyond the Dark Territory boundary was supposed to be a secret mission, but she thought it would be useless to try hiding it from a Cathedral's best intelligence agent, so she nodded.

"......Yeah, I do."

"Souvenirs should be a selection of secret elixirs from dark arts masters’ guild~"

"................ I will do my best..."

"Ha-ha, I’m joking, joking."

After displaying an innocent smile suitable for her age, Fizel sitting on the higher step turned her gaze outside the glass window.

![Image](/Translate/Img/p131.jpg)

In the direction Fizel was looking, the light of East Centoria city was blinking like stars in the abyss of dark. Traditionally in East Centoria there were many wooden buildings, so wooden and stone torches were used instead of oil lanterns, which made the city light to gain a kind of soft color.

_Far away beyond that light, "The Great Eastern Gate" rises in over 750 kilolu and the capital of Dark Territory Obsidia is even further, in more than two thousand kilolu. They taught us at the Sword Mastery Academy that its name means "the capital made of obsidian" in ancient sacred words, but the teacher did not seem to know its origin. Will I understand it when see with my own eyes, will I really go to the end in the first place to reach that city, or will it be too late and the overwhelming emotions will capture me same way as ──_

"When you get over there......."

As Fizel muttered closely, Ronye returned her gaze to a young senpai knight.

"Yes……?"

"Hmm... the war is over and I do not care too much, but ..."

There was no person in the vicinity and no one could hear the conversation of two people with the sound of all the hot water flowing down vigorously from gates in the wall, but when Fizel approached Ronye and whispered with a serious face.

"In Obsidia, keep your eyes open, be careful everywhere."

"Ye...yes...."

"Although the "Peace Treaty of the Five Peoples" has been signed, the Dark Territory is still dominated by "Law of the Strongest". The strongest one now is the Dark Territory United Forces commander Isukan, and there’s Scheta as well, so I guess from the surface it looks like they firmly suppress it, but...... Even on this side that is supposed to be bound by many ties of the Taboo Index and Human World Fundamental Law, there are still people who are disinterested in obeying them and find loopholes in the text interpreting it conveniently. So, if it is a Dark Territory that obeys much more ambiguous things than taboo or law, there is no wonder if some bad guys are hiding there."

Realizing the words of Fizel, Ronye was attacked by a feeling of hot water suddenly dropping the temperature. She started to shake a little, but Fizel stretched her right hand and tapped Ronye’s head.

"Sorry, sorry, I did not mean to scare you."

"No, it's okay. I will carve your admonition in my heart."

"Since our duties will be over by the time Ronye-chan comes back, let's invite Tiese-chan and have a party."

"Yes, by all means!"

As Ronye nodded, Fizel smiled and stood up.

"Well, then, I will have to get up early."

Waving with her right hand, the girl knight stepped on a slippery marble and left, so Ronye relaxed again.

Fizel's knight number is 29, thirtieth was the "Knight of the Fragrant Olive" Alice who left for the real world in the end of the Foreign World War, thirty-first was the "Frost Scale Whip" Eldrie who had fallen defending Alice. Since the numbers will continue after these two will be missing, if Ronye and Tiese are appointed as Integrity Knights, one of them will get the number thirty-two and the other one becomes thirty-third.

She certainly couldn’t wait for that day. But at the same time, the feeling of uncertainty was strangling her because she could not decide yet if she’s ready. Ronye at that time had sword skill, sacred art mastery and strength of mind way lower than even those of children Fizel and Linel, not to mention higher ranking knights like Renri.

_Step by step.  
I’ll move one step at a time. If you continue to train every day and learn seriously, you will definitely be able to reach where you aim._

"............ Ronye Synthesis Thirty-three ............"

She unwillingly muttered such a name and hurriedly looked around. Even though no one seemed to hear, Ronye dived in hot water to hide from embarrassment that was too big and continued to spit out bubbles until the air ended up.

## Footnotes:

1. <a name="Prim1"></a>Poisonous plant, unique to Underworld, used in manufacture. 
2. <a name="Prim2"></a>嬢 means unmarried woman, girl; 嬢ちゃん, respectively, cute little girl, “cutie”.
3. <a name="Prim3"></a>BTW, the priority and OCA here and below are written using western notation, e.g. "39" instead of "三十九", in other words, it’s “sacred numbers” that characters _pronounce_ "thirty-nine" or something like this.
4. <a name="Prim4"></a>Indian jasmine, _Jasminum sambac_
5. <a name="Prim5"></a>クロイス, probably a reference to “Legend of Heroes” series.
6. <a name="Prim6"></a>Here “Konoe Knights” should be treated as “personal Emperor’s guards”; the “Prologue III” from vol.18 contains a spoiler that unveils what will happen in Underworld with this role in the future.
7. <a name="Prim7"></a>“Yu”, or specifically kanji “湯” means hot water or hot springs. Based on the following paragraphs it seems that hot springs are not simulated by Main Visualizer — which I personally find hard to believe given who built it, but OK — so the only “yu” in Underworld should be “弓”, a bow, which is actually pronounced “yumi” but can be shortened to “yu”. You can have a glimpse of the look of cloth [here](https://ojiya-chijimi.jp/archives/31862). It is quite obvious that it serves as a pseudo-door to hot springs/hot tub area.
8. <a name="Prim8"></a>The quick #KawaharaMath calculation is obviously wrong because it ignores the fact of the “floor surfaces falling down in a staircase pattern”. Depending on whether those steps are included in 25m calculation or excluded, and on the form of steps, we get significantly more or less than 874 m<sup>3</sup>, but under no condition exactly that number. Well, at least these numbers suggest the width of Catherdal’s outer wall: ~55m (25+2+wall+2+25).
9. <a name="Prim9"></a>閑割, something like Leisure Splitter per kanji, however in this case furigana ヒマワリ is also an homonym to ひまわり which means Sunflower.
10. <a name="Prim10"></a>Fizel calls Fanatio “higher ranked older sister”. Emperor is more complicated. It’s like Fizel calls him her direct beloved grandpa, but in a somewhat official form that would be probably used by someone who is visually older than her.
