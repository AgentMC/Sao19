# Part 9

<!--<sup><a href="#Prim1">1</a></sup>-->

Kirito and Ronye returned to their apartment, changed from sleeping to regular clothes, equipped swords and began searching first from the forty-ninth floor.

However, they did not open the doors of all the rooms. Kirito has a mighty mind power to find the location of Scheta from the other side of the river, because he could sense the presence of humans and monsters through doors and walls, it was sufficient just to concentrate on the center of each floor for a while.

For two hours they continued the search running down from floor to floor occasionally showing the coat of arms plate every time guards seen them.

Finally, at the third basement floor, which was the lowest level of Obsidia castle and contained a large storehouse, Kirito closed the eyelids standing at the center of the passage crossing — and slowly shook his head.

"No, they are not here either."

Having deeply sighed, he put his back against the black rock wall. The storehouse was completely unmanned, only the light of ore lantern shook weakly in the silent pathway.

Looking at Kirito’s worried face, Ronye nervously asked him.

"Then, doesn’t it mean that they weren’t still inside the castle but escaped to the outside...?"

"Ugh......... but that means that a hurt minion flew more than three kilolu in just two minutes..."

"Th-three kilolu......? Do senpai’s senses reach so far...?"

"It depends on the target, but it's definitely about that if the opponent is the size of a minion with nothing around it. It’s 1.5 kilolu per minute, so ninety kilolu per hour...... I do not think minions that can fly at such a furious speed exist."

"It's almost like a dragon.... After all, maybe a dark knight on a dragon cooperated...?"

When Ronye asked, whispering, Kirito shook his head again.

"I can perceive a thing of a dragon size even if it is ten kilolu away<sup><a href="#Prim1">1</a></sup>. It’s not really a dragon that can fly so much in two minutes<sup><a href="#Prim2">2</a></sup>, it is rather a machine dragon..."

He cut off the word, and murmured "It can’t be", but immediately denied it.

"No...... If you use machine dragon, you should hear a terrible roaring sound. Not so much of a "stone mill drums" sound.... ── To start with, what sounds like a stone mill drum?"

Listening to it, Ronye thought hard, but I could not invent anything.

Instead she recollected the warmth of Lisetta drinking milk in her arms and laughing at the dinner. When Ronye pressed a hand to her chest, Kirito said it to her.

"Lisetta is the hope for two worlds, never gonna let this child be killed..."

In his deeply concerned voice, she felt a clear determination, and Ronye breathed in.

The face of Kirito who was leaning against the stone wall was down and covered with shadows so she could not see it. However, Ronye feverishly walked to him and grasped both shoulders of Kirito.

"....... unthinkable, senpai. It is absolutely unthinkable to sacrifice Kirito-senpai."

After keeping being silent for a while, Kirito answered, pausing after each phrase.

"I said before. If I die in this world, I won’t really die. If Lisetta cannot be secured, I......."

Ronye cut his words about that he should die by screaming at him.

"Senseless! Whatever a reason is, it does not matter... I can’t even think of never meeting my senpai again......!"

She pushed her face straight into Kirito's chest. The silver coat of arms plate bit the forehead, but such a pain was nothing compared to the tearing apart aching in the chest.

"For my entire life, to follow and serve my senpai. I decided to stay at senpai’s side forever. I do not want anything more than that.... But if senpai is sacrificed, I will follow you as well. Let us be executed together!"

She was consciously saying it in a way that suggested her becoming a hostage. But at the same time, it was Ronye's true thoughts, without any bargain.

".......Ronye..."

Calling the name with anguish, low, hoarse voice, Kirito lifted both hands and put them on Ronye's shoulders.

Kirito felt that way because he understood, it was possible to completely detain Ronye or put her to sleep even for two or three days — until everything is over. But such a thing had no meaning. If Kirito was executed when she awoke, she would follow him immediately.

However, Kirito moved his right hand to Ronye’s head and gently stroked her hair, whispering.

"...Thank you, Ronye. I will not give up. I’ll certainly save Lisetta... And then, Ronye and I, we’ll return to Cathedral. To the place of our home..."

As soon as she heard the words, tears flowed from Ronye’s both eyes. She nodded desperately struggling to speak over the crying.

"............ Yes...... Yes......."

Given up trying to say anything, Ronye just squeezed Kirito's body even stronger. Kirito had been stroking her head all the time until Ronye calmed down.

Soon after that, listening to the six o'clock morning bells they ascended to the hall of the first floor above the ground, to meet Scheta and Isukan coming back from the dark arts masters’ guild headquarters.

They got together and shared stories but unfortunately it seems that it wasn’t possible to get any information directly related to kidnappers.

"The current guild master has nothing to do with the dark arts masters mysteriously disappeared in a Foreign World War, and she did not run minions improvement experiments. I asked them as the commander, they couldn’t overcome the “law of the strongest”."

Scheta added to the words of Isukan after nodding with a depressed expression.

"However, there’s one thing...... About one month ago, it seems that from the clay production site managed by the guild, large quantities of the best-quality prepared clay disappeared."

"Large quantities...... how much exactly?"

When Kirito asked, Isukan answered with a bitter face.

"Just about of three minions size. They handled the matter internally and did not report to the Five Clans Conference...... well, even if we had heard it in advance, we could not have predicted today's raid...."

"A month ago or so...... after all, it seems that this is linked with the affair in Human World..."

This time it was Isukan who asked muttering Kirito.

"I already received reports from the guards... but how was your search?"

"Bad...... I searched the entire castle from the top floor to the lowest storage room, but neither minions nor Lisetta were found. If there are hidden rooms that even Isukan does not know about, it did not matter...... They couldn’t avoid my detection unless they hide in a completely disconnected portion of the space."

"Well if you say so... That means, they already escaped somewhere far..."

Isukan crushed the head with the silver ring on. His hands were gently held by Scheta who wrapped them with both hers.

In the silence of the hall, the sound of the castle’s large front door closing sounded gravely.

Not only the door itself but also the hinge around it seemed to have been carved off from obsidian, and the sound of heavy minerals rubbing each other was unique. It felt like she heard this sound reminding of a distant thunder recently, and Ronye traced her memory.

_It was that...... yes, at the time of the flight experiment of the machine dragon version 1 by the Central Cathedral. In order to save the dragon which would otherwise collide with the top of Cathedral, Asuna utilized the power of goddess Stacia and shifted the top of Cathedral from the 95th floor and up. Giant pieces of marble rubbed against each other, and it was just like that sound. 
Rock and rock...... Sound of rubbing. Just like a stone mill._

"...... That! Scheta-sama......."

Ronye ran over and stood in the front of the senior Integrity Knight and spoke excitedly.

"Is there a large obsidian door, like that big door, near Scheta-sama and Isukan-sama's bedroom?"

"Obsidian doors......? ── No, all the doors in the vicinity are made of wood and the exterior window bars are made of iron."

"Well, then is there any mechanism involving a rock rubbing against rock...?"

Kirito also opened his mouth when he heard this.

"The sounds of stone mill drums heard by the guards....... If there is something like a hidden door on the outer wall of the castle, it would sound this way... but......."

"If it's just a hidden door, they couldn’t cheat Kirito's nose... right?"

Isukan groaned this with arms folded.

"...Also, I’ve never heard that there is such a thing near our bedroom. Moreover, even if you make a hidden door on the outer side of the wall, no one can use it. Only someone who can fly."

"…hidden door... isn’t it perhaps...?"

Kirito who mumbled it turned his eyes to the ceiling of the hall.

"Isukan, you were saying that yourself. On top of this, 49th floor, there is a real top floor."

General commander and authorized ambassador inhaled at the same time.

".....Fif.... fiftieth floor you say....? But it's been always sealed, and the guards have confirmed the chain has not been touched."

"How about the outside? Isn’t there no window on the 50th floor?"

"............No ......... no ...... certainly......"

Escrow moved the head awkwardly.

"...... When Vector came down and ten clans of Dark Territory were gathered at that time, I certainly saw a window in the throne hall. But now, looking from the outside, there are only rocks above the 49th floor, no windows.... "

"Well, that’s your answer."

Kirito said this in convinced tone.

"When Vector died and the sealing chain restored, the rocks of the outer wall moved and all the windows were blocked. The space became completely separated. The stone mill's sound heard by the guards was the sound the rock moved again."

"But... if that’s the case…"

Isukan, whose red copper skin suddenly became pale, continued in a quiet whispering.

"It is only Emperor Vector who can break the seal of the fiftieth floor ............... It means that he kidnapped Lisa............"

But although the face of fist fighter was covered with fear, he creaked his teeth.

Scheta broke the shivering silence with resolute words.

"Let's go, on the fiftieth floor"

Immediately, Kirito also nodded.

"Yes... we can find out something if we examine the door."

Isukan nodded shaking off the fear.

Four of them again ran up to the top of the castle without a single stop. Due to the extreme situation, at the second time Ronye was able to keep up without losing breath.

She stopped at the 49th floor and looked up at the continuing stairs. Whether the castle's hot water heating did not reach here or there were other reasons, cold air falling down from the dark staircase wrapped Ronye's legs.

"……let's go"

Isukan who declared this bravely, stepped on the stairs. Three people followed.

Even though it was only one more floor, going up the stairs felt longer than from the first floor to the forty-ninth floor somehow, but eventually they saw a black double door ahead. As they said, there were huge chains that seemed to have more than ten centimeters in width binding left and right doors. It's tightly wrapped, not hanging at all.

Isukan, who slowly walked down a short corridor in front of the big door, touched the gray chain with his right hand, and moaned "cold" and pulled it back. But then he reached out again and held the chain tightly this time. He dropped it down and pulled with all his might, but the chain did not move, even a faint metal sound didn’t echo.

## Footnotes:

1. <a name="Prim1"></a>#KawaharaMath In vol.18 Kirito has been revived about 1500 to 2000 kilolu to the north of the World End Alter (see illustration). Not only was he able to locate the “huge heterogenous object” at least 1000 kilolu to the south (Alice would reach Alter in \~6 hours if Kirito flies at \~300 km/h, so Subtilizer who is slightly faster than 120 km/h being dragon’s max speed, let’s say, 150 km/h ,would be in about 1100 km from Kirito at the moment of him finishing off Vasago), but also to fly these 1500 to 2000 kilolu with Asuna in hands over even less productive area than “normal” Dark Territory where he can “fly in a stable manner” for 10 kilolu only.
2. <a name="Prim2"></a>#KawaharaMath Nope, it could, remember, 120 km/h max?
