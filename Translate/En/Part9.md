# Part 9

Kirito and Ronye returned to their apartment, changed from sleeping to regular clothes, equipped swords and began searching first from the forty-ninth floor.

However, they did not open the doors of all the rooms. Kirito has a mighty mind power to find the location of Scheta from the other side of the river, because he could sense the presence of humans and monsters through doors and walls, it was sufficient just to concentrate on the center of each floor for a while.

For two hours they continued the search running down from floor to floor occasionally showing the coat of arms plate every time guards seen them.

Finally, at the third basement floor, which was the lowest level of Obsidia castle and contained a large storehouse, Kirito closed the eyelids standing at the center of the passage crossing — and slowly shook his head.

"No, they are not here either."

Having deeply sighed, he put his back against the black rock wall. The storehouse was completely unmanned, only the light of ore lantern shook weakly in the silent pathway.

Looking at Kirito’s worried face, Ronye nervously asked him.

"Then, doesn’t it mean that they weren’t still inside the castle but escaped to the outside...?"

"Ugh......... but that means that a hurt minion flew more than three kilolu in just two minutes..."

"Th-three kilolu......? Do senpai’s senses reach so far...?"

"It depends on the target, but it's definitely about that if the opponent is the size of a minion with nothing around it. It’s 1.5 kilolu per minute, so ninety kilolu per hour...... I do not think minions that can fly at such a furious speed exist."

"It's almost like a dragon.... After all, maybe a dark knight on a dragon cooperated...?"

When Ronye asked, whispering, Kirito shook his head again.

"I can perceive a thing of a dragon size even if it is ten kilolu away<sup><a href="#Prim1">1</a></sup>. It’s not really a dragon that can fly so much in two minutes<sup><a href="#Prim2">2</a></sup>, it is rather a machine dragon..."

He cut off the word, and murmured "It can’t be", but immediately denied it.

"No...... If you use machine dragon, you should hear a terrible roaring sound. Not so much of a "stone mill drums" sound.... ── To start with, what sounds like a stone mill drum?"

Listening to it, Ronye thought hard, but I could not invent anything.

Instead she recollected the warmth of Lisetta drinking milk in her arms and laughing at the dinner. When Ronye pressed a hand to her chest, Kirito said it to her.

"Lisetta is the hope for two worlds, never gonna let this child be killed..."

## Footnotes:

1. <a name="Prim1"></a>#KawaharaMath In vol.18 Kirito has been revived about 1500 to 2000 kilolu to the north of the World End Alter (see illustration). Not only was he able to locate the “huge heterogenous object” at least 1000 kilolu to the south (Alice would reach Alter in \~6 hours if Kirito flies at \~300 km/h, so Subtilizer who is slightly faster than 120 km/h being dragon’s max speed, let’s say, 150 km/h ,would be in about 1100 km from Kirito at the moment of him finishing off Vasago), but also to fly these 1500 to 2000 kilolu with Asuna in hands over even less productive area than “normal” Dark Territory where he can “fly in a stable manner” for 10 kilolu only.
2. <a name="Prim2"></a>#KawaharaMath Nope, it could, remember, 120 km/h max?
