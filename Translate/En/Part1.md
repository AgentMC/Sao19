# Part 1

"Ronye, over here!"

Standing on tip toes and looking at the direction from where the voice came, she saw the burning red hair swaying across the crowd.

She was muttering apologizes “I am sorry, I am sorry” to Central Cathedral's clerics and staff members while pushing her way through. Several people turned around, somewhat frustrated, but after noticing Tsukigaki following Ronye, gave the way.

Somehow Ronye made it to the front row and breathed a deep breath.

"Hey, finally, it starts already!"

The redhead girl inflating cheeks was the best friend of Ronye, who turned and apologized.

"I'm sorry, I got lost as to what to wear ......"

"Got… lost, but in the end, stayed with your usual appearance"

The name of a surprised girl was Tiese Shtolienen. She was in the same status of Integrity Knight apprentice as Ronye. Autumn-colored eyes similar to her hair were shining vividly, her slim body was wrapped in cute patterned jacket and indigo skirt. She had lowered the red leather sheath on the waist, it even seems to be a sort of jewelry fitted with clothes.

_I should have brought the Southern Empire shawl I bought last week_, regretted the other one moving her gaze away, noticing Shimosaki<sup><a href="#Prim1">1</a></sup>, the young dragon she was raising, rubbing against Tsukigaki’s nose, and a young man wearing a gentle smile behind Tiese.

He was looking more like a boy than a young man, but the in addition to heavy long sword he was equipped with two crossed knives bent in the middle. Priority which is given to the sword was also considerable, but the one of throwing blades was simply outrageous. That weapon that looks thin like paper was nothing else than a "sacred treasure" class weapon.

Ronye lifted the right fist, moved an arm horizontally and hit the chest, and placed the left hand on the handle of the sword greeting the young man with the formal knight bow.

"Good morning, Renri-sama<sup><a href="#Prim2">2</a></sup>"

Integrity Knight Renri Synthesis Twenty-Seven answered to that with a wry smile from the other side of the dragons.

"Good morning, Ronye-san ...... You do not have to worry about fight so much, as today it's a long-awaited fest."

"Fest... What fest is it?"

She tilted her head unconsciously.

_Today ── it is the seventeenth February, three hundred and eighty-second year according to the Human World calendar, just a regular weekday.  
Also, neither in the "Human World Basic Law" issued last year, nor in the “Taboo Index” being actively revised, there is not a single line instructing to celebrate this day._

However, looking around, the vast Central Cathedral front square was crowded with as many onlookers as the total count of it’s staff. Everyone seemed to have a terrible trouble trying to get drinks and snacks.

Furthermore, the front gate of Cathedral which is usually closed tightly seemed to be open to citizens of the central capital today. Two improvised standing areas provided on the left and right of the main gate inside, were crowded with the number of onlookers which could easily surpass a thousand.

"... Well, can’t name this anything but a festival. Can’t help it, senpai...... When Prime Swordsman does something, it definitely looks like this"

Ronye also nodded to the words that Tiese spoken with embarrassed face.

"Well, I guess.... Let’s hope he won’t destroy Cathedral today"

On the other side of the crowd, where three people gathered their line of sight ──

As they say, the words could not describe it.

The strange sound echoed from the space in the middle of the front square, a separated area of about one hundred square mel, and on a pure white stone floor, a “metal dragon statue” appeared.

However, as a proof that it is not just a decoration, the upper part of the sharp head was made of transparent glass. Short wings attached to the left and right sides of the trunk were flat, and instead of legs, two thick cylinders stretched out from a big swollen back. There was no tail.

It can be said that it’s total length was about 5 mel, and orange flames were peeking out from the holes above and below the cylinders and in the back, but it’s identity could not be understood at all.

_……One thing certain is that it makes me feel badly disgusted._

Muttering this deep within her heart, Ronye removed her gaze from a metallic dragon and stared at three people standing nearby.

Then one of them ── a young swordswoman with the long chestnut hair fluttering in the breeze having a fine sword hanging on the left hip on top of a pearl skirt, turned back as if feeling Ronye's gaze. She smiled once and raised a hand as if beckoning her.

"Hey, come over here"

As Tiese got hesitant and stepped back for a moment, Ronye moved forward and soon daringly crossed the yellow barrier rope. Behind her back, of course, followed Tsukigaki.

Under focused gaze of numerous spectators gathered, pulling her head in to the limit, she slowly crossed the square. Stopping in front of a swordswoman, she stretched out to the fingertips and returned the knight’s greeting again.

"Good morning, Vice-Prime Swordsman-sama"

"Good morning, Ronye-san. It looks like we’re celebrating today, so you can make it more comfortable"

She said that while having a light smile on her face beautiful enough to be disappointing, and Ronye relaxed shoulders and answered.

"...... Yes, Asuna-sama"

"I told you so many times, don’t add that “sama”"
