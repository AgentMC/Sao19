# Part 1

"Ronye, over here!"

Standing on tip toes and looking at the direction from where the voice came, she saw the burning red hair swaying across the crowd.

She was muttering apologizes “I am sorry, I am sorry” to Central Cathedral's clerics and staff members while pushing her way through. Several people turned around, somewhat frustrated, but after noticing Tsukigaki following Ronye, gave the way.

Somehow Ronye made it to the front row and breathed a deep breath.

"Hey, finally, it starts already!"

The redhead girl inflating cheeks was the best friend of Ronye, who turned and apologized.

"I'm sorry, I got lost as to what to wear ......"

"Got… lost, but in the end, stayed with your usual appearance"

The name of a surprised girl was Tiese Shtolienen. She was in the same status of Integrity Knight apprentice as Ronye. Autumn-colored eyes similar to her hair were shining vividly, her slim body was wrapped in cute patterned jacket and indigo skirt. She had lowered the red leather sheath on the waist, it even seems to be a sort of jewelry fitted with clothes.

_I should have brought the Southern Empire shawl I bought last week_, regretted the other one moving her gaze away, noticing Shimosaki<sup><a href="#Prim1">1</a></sup>, the young dragon she was raising, rubbing against Tsukigaki’s nose, and a young man wearing a gentle smile behind Tiese.

He was looking more like a boy than a young man, but the in addition to heavy long sword he was equipped with two crossed knives bent in the middle. Priority which is given to the sword was also considerable, but the one of throwing blades was simply outrageous. That weapon that looks thin like paper was nothing else than a "sacred treasure" class weapon.

Ronye lifted the right fist, moved an arm horizontally and hit the chest, and placed the left hand on the handle of the sword greeting the young man with the formal knight bow.

"Good morning, Renri-sama<sup><a href="#Prim2">2</a></sup>"

Integrity Knight Renri Synthesis Twenty-Seven answered to that with a wry smile from the other side of the dragons.

"Good morning, Ronye-san ...... You do not have to worry about fight so much, as today it's a long-awaited fest."

"Fest... What fest is it?"

She tilted her head unconsciously.

_Today ── it is the seventeenth February, three hundred and eighty-second year according to the Human World calendar, just a regular weekday.  
Also, neither in the "Human World Basic Law" issued last year, nor in the “Taboo Index” being actively revised, there is not a single line instructing to celebrate this day._

However, looking around, the vast Central Cathedral front square was crowded with as many onlookers as the total count of it’s staff. Everyone seemed to have a terrible trouble trying to get drinks and snacks.

Furthermore, the front gate of Cathedral which is usually closed tightly seemed to be open to citizens of the central capital today. Two improvised standing areas provided on the left and right of the main gate inside, were crowded with the number of onlookers which could easily surpass a thousand.

"... Well, can’t name this anything but a festival. Can’t help it, senpai...... When Prime Swordsman does something, it definitely looks like this"

Ronye also nodded to the words that Tiese spoken with embarrassed face.

"Well, I guess.... Let’s hope he won’t destroy Cathedral today"

On the other side of the crowd, where three people gathered their line of sight ──

As they say, the words could not describe it.

The strange sound echoed from the space in the middle of the front square, a separated area of about one hundred square mel, and on a pure white stone floor, a “metal dragon statue” appeared.

However, as a proof that it is not just a decoration, the upper part of the sharp head was made of transparent glass. Short wings attached to the left and right sides of the trunk were flat, and instead of legs, two thick cylinders stretched out from a big swollen back. There was no tail.

It can be said that it’s total length was about 5 mel, and orange flames were peeking out from the holes above and below the cylinders and in the back, but it’s identity could not be understood at all.

_……One thing certain is that it makes me feel badly disgusted._

Muttering this deep within her heart, Ronye removed her gaze from a metallic dragon and stared at three people standing nearby.

Then one of them ── a young swordswoman with the long chestnut hair fluttering in the breeze having a fine sword hanging on the left hip on top of a pearl skirt, turned back as if feeling Ronye's gaze. She smiled once and raised a hand as if beckoning her.

"Hey, come over here"

As Tiese got hesitant and stepped back for a moment, Ronye moved forward and soon daringly crossed the yellow barrier rope. Behind her back, of course, followed Tsukigaki.

Under focused gaze of numerous spectators gathered, pulling her head in to the limit, she slowly crossed the square. Stopping in front of a swordswoman, she stretched out to the fingertips and returned the knight’s greeting again.

"Good morning, Vice-Prime Swordsman-sama"

"Good morning, Ronye-san. It looks like we’re celebrating today, so you can make it more comfortable"

She said that while having a light smile on her face beautiful enough to be disappointing, and Ronye relaxed shoulders and answered.

"...... Yes, Asuna-sama"

"I told you so many times, don’t add that “sama”"

She sharpened her lips, but it was hard to accept this.

A woman standing before Ronye’s eyes and looking a little older than her — a Vice Prime Swordsman of the Human World Union Council Asuna — was respected by everyone, in a sense, respected more than the Prime Swordsman himself. Because she was believed by all the people of the Human World that to be a reincarnation of "Genesis God Stasia", one of the three goddesses of Genesis mythology.

While she continues to deny that she is actually a god, Ronye witnessed a scene where Asuna have created a huge rift in the ground with a sword to cut the inevitable clash with other army. _Once you’ve seen that, you cannot even imagine omitting "sama"._

Even directly ordered 『do not add “sama”』by the higher Knight whom she should be obliged to obey, she swung her purple neck left and right with the firm intention to continue, seeing which Asuna switched the subject with a bitter smile.

"So, Ronye-san. You are the best in thermal element sacred art, aren’t you?"

"I… yes, I am"

Feeling awkward, she nodded. Asuna then moved her face close and continued in a low voice.

"Well then, there is a little favor to ask. As we have thermal elements array and you have mutual predisposition to each other, I would like you to teach me how to let them out."

"Eh, oh ......? Is there a thermal element in it?"

Ronnie could not immediately understand the meaning of words, and she moved her gaze, blinking.

She looked up at the highest point of a metal dragon, and then saw two men discussing something beside it.

"...... all in all, Kiri-boy, even if you say that the thermal element can is computationally resistant to the heat that one generates, that is because there is sufficient supply of permanent freezing! Grandson is not good at cryogenic element, so if you take any delay during the sacred art, the fully charged element can will blow in a blink of an eye!"

The one proclaiming this loud speech full of unknown words was a man of about fifty years old owning a magnificent beard. That person well-known to Ronye, was a metalworker producing the best armor in the capital city of Centoria named Sadore. For a long time, he used to operate a shop in a downtown, and after a cooperation with the Integrity Knights Order in the "Rebellion of the Four Empires", he took office as Central Cathedral's chief engineer.

The one being spoken to by Sadore-shi<sup><a href="#Prim3">3</a></sup>  immediately became totally blushed, like a little kid ──

With black hair and black eyes, his appearance was one of a fairly ordinary young man.

He wore long-sleeved jacket and trousers of a strange gray color. There was no weapon on his waist. He combined hands fitted with brown leather gloves behind the head and talked back to old Sadore with a slightly tired face.

"Hey, hearing this hurts my ear like an insect lurking inside. Old man, I guess it’s time to stop that “Kiri-boy”."

"Hmph, don’t even hope it. Since that day three years ago, when you brought that hard branch to my shop so I had to completely use six grinding stones of precious black rocks to sharpen him into a sword, I decided to call you my grandson forever."

"...... Mind you, without that sword, this world would be in great trouble..."

The complaining young man suddenly turned around and saw Ronye.

Since they met for the first time, he did not change, leaving an impression of a somewhat childish person. As soon as Ronye saw a wide smile on his face, something tightened deep in her chest.

Ronnie lowered her head, aspiring not to put it on the table.

"Good morning, Kirito-senpai"

This time she would like to use “sama” as well, but exclusively for this person a “sama ban” was actually issued in official documents. So unavoidably, she used “senpai” as she would do back then when they both were students.

Former Elite Swordsmen Trainee at the Sword Mastery Academy in North Centoria, a young man named Kirito who is currently appointed to the position of the Prime Swordsman of the Human World Union Council, said raising his right hand with a smile.

"Oh, Ronye! How are you doing?"

A young dragon appeared from behind of Ronye and loudly singing “kurururu” and flapping small wings it pounced on Kirito and began licking his cheeks without refrain. After smiling involuntarily from the look of that situation, she also greeted Sadore.

"Good morning, master."

"Oh, good morning, young Ronye."

Having exchanged that, Ronye quickly approached the old man with a gentle smile, and asked.

"So, that ...... you were taking about just now, what is it like, that thermal element can?"

"Well, here, look at the back of “machine dragon” prototype No. 1"

"Machine... dragon?"

It was an unfamiliar word once again, but she quickly understood that it was the name of a metallic dragon that aroused in front of her.

Looking at it again she felt somewhat uncomfortable to call “dragon” a creature without life which the emitted strange sound called “Hiruuruuru” from the back part swollen in an elliptical shape.

"There, two charged containers made from western adamant steel, there are only 10 thermal elements contained in each".

"Eh....... Eeeeh!"

As soon as she heard of it, Ronye bend backward filling dizzy.

Thermal element was the most difficult thing among the eight attributes being the source of sacred art. Unlike the cryogenic and the aerial ones which can be kept in the space for a while, if you leave it as generated, it will quickly emit heat and light and disappear. If you use thermal element, you must never lose concentration until it is processed or discharged — that is the first fundamental thing apprentice clerics are taught of.

"Well, such a...... But even adamant steel with highest heat resistance, if you leave it in contact with ten heat elements, won’t it melt and explode...?"

"There is a contrivance. On the outside of the container, there is a pipe made of Yorund giant centipede husk which has high freezing resistance. It is a rough pipe system connected to sealed cans with cryogenic element supplying cold air there to prevent hot cans from melting."

"............... It is, ehm ............"

Even though it is said to be a contrivance, for Ronye thermal and cryogenic elements are the sources of the sacred art which is the sacrament of Gods and is far from the smith craft and metalworking. She has never thought of what will happen when combining the two.

"............... That thing, so what will happen if it works...?"

Murmuring distantly, master Sadore spread out his stubborn hands.

"Well, it’s pretty clear."

"Eee!"

"Old Kiri-boy will ride this thing."

"Eeeeee~~!?"

_Ride — heck, does this make any sense now?_

Fearfully she moved her face and looked up at the tip of the “machine dragon”.

Then, she noticed that there is a thing that seems to be nothing but a chair installed inside the head with a transparent glass plate combined in a sharp shape. There were a metallic pipe and a number of small disks attached around the chair. A thin needle in the center of one disk seemed to be trembling finely in sync with strange sounds.

"............ Well, no way ...... Someone sitting there, then...... releasing the thermal element...... from the barrel in the back of it, and then............."

"Swish! Flying... Like a dragon in the sky."

It was Kirito who stood next before she finished.

Next to them, Tsukigaki sniffed the metal wings of the “machine dragon”, and turned away with clearly disappointed face.

"Un......, un..., un..., unreasonable, senpai!"

She shouted while pulling the sleeve of Kirito 's strange clothes.
