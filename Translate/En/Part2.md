# Part 2

The Central Cathedral fiftieth floor, called the "Great Corridor of the Spiritual Light" was a conference hall for the current "Human World Union Council".

In the middle of the floor where only polished marble was spread, there was a huge round table cut out from an ancient platinum oak, surrounded by twenty chairs.

It was Kirito who sit on one of them shrinking his neck. A large man standing in front of him roared a thunder-like voice.

"Today you shall hear my word, Prime Swordsman-dono<sup><a href="#Prim1">1</a></sup>!"

"............ Yes"

"This time you haven’t destroyed anything! But I swear by my sword, next time you won’t be so fortunate!!"

"………………Yes"

The knight wearing heavy brass armor rebuking him like a teacher was the strongest swordsman in the Human World. His face was the reflection of the term fortitude itself, the hair was short trimmed and his sharp eyes blazed. That was Dusolbert Synthesis Seven, one of the oldest integrity knights.

"Even though Asuna-sama revealed her divine power, the Cathedral from 95th floor is now char black! Although those floors are currently unused, the symbol and landmark of "tower of chalk" became "tower of embers". How much grief and sorrow are the people of the central city suffering! You, Prime Swordsman-dono, must be aware that you are in a position of heavy responsibility which you clearly lack! Having the need for advanced tools or sacred art, you could leave it to a cleric or a blacksmith who have it as their profession!"

A slender knight sitting in a close distance raised from the table to interrupt the Dusolbert’s sermon, which seemed to last forever.

"Let's finish it up, Dusolbert. The Prime Swordsman-dono is already withered like a namekuri<sup><a href="#Prim2">2</a></sup> in the sun."

The owner of glossy voice inducing laughter was a female knight who wore an armor polished like a mirror and had a black hair waving on his back. On the left of her waist there was a slender long sword with a white-silver pattern, and with her right arm she held a small child with indigo hair rare in the Human World.

"But, the knight commander..."

"It is awkward to repeat so much but I’m more afraid if the Prime-dono simply escapes. We don’t have a consultation with the Dark Territory next month."

The name of the woman beautiful as a blooming flower who was called the commander was Fanatio Synthesis Two. She was a person with the world's highest sword power and held the leading position of the Second-Generation Integrity Knights, though it was hard to notice this from her appearance of slowly shaking a sleeping baby.

Fanatio looked directly to Kirito who was still sitting head down and said with a smile.

"That's why, please be quiet for a while, boy."

To that Kirito raised his face a bit wearing a big bitter smile.

"It is much more frightening to be called “boy” than “Prime”."

"He-he, I guess it frightens you because there’s a dark background behind it"

And Fanatio sent a sidelong glance to where there was a figure of Vice-Prime Swordsman Asuna with her arms folded. Although she also smiled, it felt her eyes were a little narrowed.

Then Fanatio also directed the line of sight to Ronye standing next to the pillar away from the round table, smiling a sort of mischievous smile. But immediately she returned her glance back and tapped the Kirito’s shoulder.

"Well, this time there was no actual harm, and I will beg your pardon should there be any further accusations. Instead, I'll do the office exactly until dinner."

"............es"

Having released both shoulders of Kirito and nodded to the each chair around the table, Fanatio again beckoned watching Ronye. The latter quickly came up, and she held out the baby she was holding to her.

"Ronye, I'm sorry but I wonder if you can take care of Berchie. Around this time, if left alone, he will break something."

"Sure, yes, my pleasure!"

Having answered, the knight chief passed on a sleeping baby to the arms of Ronye. She was surprised by the weight felt by her arm. As an integrity knights apprentice, Ronye could swing with one hand both Human World’s weapon or a large two-mel length sword from the Dark Territory, but the weight of a child seemed quite different from that of a weapon.

One-year-old Berchie firmly hugged to her chest with both arms and let out some murmuring, but immediately returned to restful sleep again. She bowed to Fanatio and returned to the wall. Tsukigaki waiting there stretched its nose to smell Berchie and seemed to be interested.

At the round table, Kirito, Asuna, Fanatio, Dusolbert, the head of clerics once used to be a monk and chiefs of various departments of the Cathedral sat around and started a meeting immediately.

"First of all, about the reopening of the mountain range in the Southern cave, which was reported the other day ..."

"Although it is possible to dig a cave, it takes quite a while to build a highway in the southern jungle area ..."

Since that day was not a formal meeting, the knight apprentice Ronye was not obliged to stay in this place. In fact, she was going to join her friend Tiese who was studying in the big library to close the gaps in her sacred art.

But there was something Ronye secretly wanted to ask Kirito. When watching the flight experiment in the morning, she suddenly felt the need to confirm or reject the idea that came into her mind. But since Kirito would flew away as soon as Cathedral staff takes their eyes off him — to shopping streets of Centoria or to some city or village somewhere in the Human World as he has already done when things got rough, she intended to catch him quickly at the end of this meeting.

Training the incarnation, one may keep standing for a few hours with one foot on the top of a thin iron pole, but waiting for the end of this meeting with her back by the pillar was causing more impatience. _But as long as there’s Tsukigaki here, who is by its nature much calmer young dragon than Tiese’s Shimosaki, I won’t get tired of propping the pillar._

While standing still listening to lively discussions, the baby snugly cuddled in her arms suddenly sneezed.

Although it did not appear to wake up, it might be cold so she moved a few steps to bring it in the light of Solus which was falling from a high window. The soft indigo hair glowed and glittered as the sunlight fell on the plump baby face, and Ronye held her breath for a moment to adore its innocent beauty.

_............ Baby......._

She smiled quietly murmuring the word.

But then, her consciousness wandered to memories that couldn’t be said to be very enjoyable, when she returned to a birthplace in the northern part of the capital last month.

***

The Arabel family, from generation to generation, was a family given the 6<sup>th</sup>, lowest ranking in the old aristocratic system.

The life was never wealthy. Without having resources of a senior aristocracy, such as territory, the income was composed of her father’s salary who was the platoon leader in the empire guard and very small baron allowance. As if that’s not enough, there was a tremendous tax every month, far from not only first- or second-class, but not even close to a merchant holding a large store in the center of Centoria.

Still, she spent every day very happy, surrounded by kind and housewifely mother, a strict but friendly father, and a naughty little brother.

The only depressing moment was the occasional party held at her father's birthplace, the house of fourth class aristocrat. Her grandfather, who was a father of four, had been called to heaven by the time Ronye was still a baby, and the eldest son, Ronye’s uncle, the head of a family with insufferable aristocratic temperament ── took over the house. Her gorgeously looking aunt was disgusting when she falsely praised Ronye's mother's old dress and things like that were inevitable so she didn’t want to go at those parties every time.

However, after the “Rebellion of Four Empires” has been finished, the aristocratic system was greatly reformed. All their land was released. Aristocracy classes were also abolished. Only the soldiers' allowance was left behind, but that alone was not enough and every aristocrat had to get a job at the restructured “human forces army”.

For the former Emperors families, this change was the same as a natural disaster, but if you ask Ronye, it has only become the proper way it should finally be. The era of loud titles and high ranks granted solely because of the origin was over and sword power and intelligence, as well as experience and knowledge, allowed people to take up key positions.

In conclusion, it can be said that now the credit given by state to every aristocrat, was equalized.

But there are a few exceptions.

Specifically, from all the former aristocrats in Centoria, two people were brought into an Integrity Knights apprenticeship: Ronye of the house Arabel, and Tiese of the house Shtolienen.

Last month Ronnie returned to her parents' house for the first time after she became a knight apprentice. Parents and younger brothers whom she hasn’t seen for the whole year were all happy, especially her younger brother, a student of Northern Centoria Sword Masters Academy, who tried to swing Ronye's sword — and could not even draw it — than challenged Ronye to arm-wrestling — and wasn’t able to push in half a cen — which made him terribly excited. Her father asked about the life in Cathedral, her mother's cooking was as delicious as ever, it was a fun night.

The next day, three father's older brothers and their families unexpectedly arrived very early, and they brought plenty of gifts.

In other words, there were marriage proposals to Ronye.

Should Ronye ever be formally entitled Integrity Knight, a guardian from the former Axiom Church, she would be getting overwhelming awe and respect from the entire Human World. These emotions remained almost unchanged even though the Church has been reformed to the “Human World Union Council". It’s even vice-versa, as the number of Integrity Knights have lost their lives in a foreign world war, the appreciation of their heroism has only increased.

If you take such a knight as a bride, the house's status and income will rise at once — and it seemed that her uncle and aunt were thinking this direction. They were from a house of the oldest son. A house of a direct heir. They gathered up a mountain of presents and being proud that they brought so much, they stacked it up in front of Ronye.

_── No matter if I’m the knight apprentice, the most important role of a woman is to give birth and bring up a child. Sure, they say even the head of integrity knights, even that kind of person raises a baby. And there is no law that could say anything is wrong with “my recommendation is my son”, but not like this, not with this person..._

In the past, Kirito secretly told Ronnie and Tiese.

The Highest Priest who ruled the former Axiom Church gathered those who excelled in sword skill and sacred art from all empires and turned them into an integrity knight. However, in fact, knights were deprived from previous memories by the forbidden technique called “The synthesis ritual”, and instead they were given false memories that they were summoned from the divine world.

Of course, it was a terrible act, but standing in front of her uncles and aunts Ronye could not help thinking it was a brilliant idea in terms of streamlining the administration of the Order.

Suppressing her feelings and a wish to create a smoke screen with sacred art and simply escape, Ronye could hardly explain that neither there is a high allowance for the knight, nor a territory for their children. However, her uncle did not try to believe it at all, and finally he became angry saying that Ronye must be luxuriously lavish in Cathedral every day, which made her father angry, so they were finally chased away, and she escaped the danger.

But ──

In her mind, Ronnie could not help thinking _“Thank you Dad”_ and bowing.

_My father told me that I should marry a man who really wanted to marry me, but in his deepest thoughts he must want to see the grandchild's face as soon as possible. No, even before, both father and mother were concerned that their daughter has joined Integrity Knights._ If not for the war, Ronye would normally graduate from the Sword Master Academy, marry some archetypal second or third son or a son-in-law of some low-class aristocrat, following the footsteps of her ancestors from the Arabel family.

That's why it was clear they at least want to have Ronye properly married and given birth to her children.

She would definitely want to fulfil that wish, if she could.

But Ronye had to leave her birthplace and return to Cathedral and apologize many times deep in her heart.

_── I'm sorry, father. Mother. Maybe I will never get married for a lifetime and I won’t have children.  
── Because my feelings will never reach that person._

***

Baby Berchie in her arms woke up and interrupted Ronye's thoughts with a small sob.

Hastily, she gently rocked him with awkward hand movements. But there was no sign of sobs stopping.

"Hey, good boy, good boy."

Though she tried hard to comfort him but the face of the baby instantly dyed red and distorted, ready to transition to crying ─

Just before that, hands stretched from the front and lifted the disgruntled boy.

"He won’t be satisfied with that, this child"

Who was standing there was his mother, the knight commander Fanatio. Smile full of charm on a beautiful face framed with smooth black hair.

"Sail high!"

In other words, she tossed baby Berchie free of support straight up. It was a completely light gesture, but made with the strongest Integrity Knight's strength.

As the child swirled around, it risen high in the air, aiming for the tremendously high ceiling of the “Great Corridor of the Spiritual Light”.

"Nah....... Fuanah...... ah, aboo......!" 

Ronye froze at his strange voice. The boy stopped at the point where he almost touched the ceiling picture depicting gods, and started to fall straight down.

And again, he fell precisely in both hands of his mother. Immediately he started to laugh and make loud joyful sounds.

"Indeed, the future concerns me. Ronye, thanks for looking after him. I will do my best from now on."

Smiling Fanatio left her and headed for the exit. The meeting was already over, so Dusolbert and the heads of departments also followed.

"...... that’s another method of bringing up a kid......"

She heard the whispering voice of amazed Kirito, standing with half a fearful face. Next to him stood Asuna wearing a subtle smile.

"Well, well, as they will become knights and ride the dragons, isn’t it a good thing to be accustomed to high places?"

"With this baby and Scheta’s one, the future seems more and more uncer...... tain, I mean fun."

Shaking his head Kirito put hands on his waist.

"As today's work has been done, I got to take a little look at the state of Unit 2..."

"Oh, uhhhhhhhh? Are you ready for the next one?"

"That one is amazing — there is a fumes compressor between the thermal engine and the thruster, such a turbo......."

"Well, Kirito-kun, I’d say you must be doing something about safety before increasing the power!"

While they were having that conversation where there were more sacred words then normal ones, Ronnie managed to raise her hand.

"Ah, that ....... Sorry, Kirito-senpai ..."

"Hmm?"

"Oh, I, a question...... I have something I'd like to ask......."

Surprised Kirito blinked his black eyes for a moment, but soon gently smiled and nodded.

"Oh, good. Well then, why don’t we have a little early tea. What do you think Asuna?"

At the direction of his line of sight, the Vice-Prime Swordsman raised a voice "Umm".

"I'd like to go out with you, but after this I am supposed to take a sacred art lecture at the big library."

"I see. The second-generation librarians are so scary. It is better not and skip......"

"Only for non-serious students"

Smiling at Kirito and patting him on the back, Asuna went a step away and turned to Ronye.

"Well, at the tea time, Ronye-san, please make sure Kirito does not eat to many sweets"

"I, I understood!"

Ronye lowered her head and glanced at Kirito who babbled something unclear while Asuna walked away leaving a rainbow-colored reflection<sup><a href="#Prim3">3</a></sup>. Kirito waited until her back disappeared in the big southern door and turned around.

"Well then. So, let’s...... haven’t been there for a long time, would you like to go to the 80th floor? And Ronye, I want to have the Yukimomo<sup><a href="#Prim4">4</a></sup> cake."

"Affirmative. I’ll fetch some from the kitchen."

"I’d say best is two... well, better three pieces, well then you get’em and I go ahead!"

Without giving Ronnie a single chance to pinch his mouth, Kirito disappeared in the northern door leading to the lift shaft.

And already from there, he shouted in a loud voice to Ronye, who let her hands fall down onto the neck of Tsukigaki approaching her.

"...It would be better to take the whole thing."

***

In the large kitchen on the 10th floor Ronye found round cakes with plenty of sugar icing with called Yukimomo ─ that was chief’s special, ─ put one in a basket with a pot of tea and headed to the 80th floor of Cathedral.

The automatic elevator she took swiftly lifted her. This device was once operated by the hand of a human, but now the girl who was working like some sort of automate has been liberated from her awful job and they say now she is anticipated as an owner of an outstanding aerial sacred art skill and holds apposition in the arsenal.

The 80th floor of the Central Cathedral known as "The Cloudtop Garden", was an indoor flower garden. In the middle of the vast grassland fully covered with innumerable flowers, on the top of a smoothly raised hill there was a figure of a Human World Prime Swordsman in his black clothes.

Kirito stood with a right hand on the young olive tree<sup><a href="#Prim5">5</a></sup> planted in the center of the hill, but smiling turned around when Ronye approached.

"Oh, sorry I had to bother you."

"It’s nothing, because this is also a responsibility of a trainee."

Returning a smile, Ronnie quickly spread the rug. She took out the dishes from the basket and handed the cake cut into big chunks out to Kirito whose eyes shined like those of a child. She took a slice for herself and for Tsukigaki, poured tea into two cups and said "Here you are".

"Enjoy the meals!"

Shouting, Kirito started stuffing his mouth as if competing with the dragon. Watching this picture, Ronye was feeling warmth spreading from the deep of her chest.

_In times like now, when I can stay with Kirito like this and have this comforting feeling, I only wish one thing. I wish I had time freeze sacred art...... then, I’d freeze this moment forever._

But of course, there’s no sacred art of time manipulation<sup><a href="#Prim6">6</a></sup>. One can’t go back in time, it can’t be stopped, it keeps constantly flowing towards the future.

Because of the nature of the time, this world has overcome the greatest crisis and thus it was possible to obtain perfect peace. Someday Ronye will be officially appointed to be an Integrity Knight, and the day will come when she rides on the Tsukigaki’s back who grew up and soars the sky. Of course, she was looking forward to that time. But this very moment, another wish has engulfed her. _Stop, time, stop._

"....... nye. Ronye?"

Ronye who suddenly heard Kirito's voice, raised a startled face.

"Oh, I'm sorry! Another piece?"

"No, well, I want it, but ... that's something else."

Presenting an empty dish while saying so, Kirito slightly tilted his head.

"Certainly, have you not told me there’s something you want to ask me about?"

"Ah……"

Finally remembering her own words, Ronye hurriedly spoke.

"I'm sorry! Well... that’s about that iron dragon my senpai made, uh,... ”machine dragon” thing."

Kirito nodded while grudgingly devouring two pieces received from Ronye.

"Yup"

"Oh, somehow, I thought .... No, I was rather worried......."

Unconsciously throwing looks to the right and left, Ronye asked in a low voice.

"Could it be... senpai is planning to .......jump over the "end wall of the world" with that machine dragon?

As soon as Kirito heard this strange voice, he struck the air with his right hand while hitting his chest with his left hand. Ronye hurriedly grasped the cup of tea, drinking it all at once and let out a long breath.

After that, the black-haired young man smiled like a mischievous child who had not changed at all since when they first met.

"......something that I expect from a mentored trainee. An ability to keep secrets."

"Sure, yes, I can!"

"Yeah, well, I do."

Having nodded as if not saying anything special, Kirito sat rubbing his chin. Ronye stared at him for a moment, stunned.

The end wall of the world. It is the common name for the cliff of an infinite height surrounding the Underworld consisting of the Human World and the Dark Territory.

It was too far from Centoria, so Ronye has seen it melting in the blue sky with her own eyes only once. While following Kirito she had visited the Mountain Goblin areal in the northern part of the Dark Territory, she noticed a breathtaking view of an incredible cliffing upstanding from behind the horizon.

According to goblins’ stories, the wall seemed to be made of ultra-hard mineral, not soil. It was not easy to open a small hole especially digging a cave or staircase. It seems that everyone who tried to climb it in the history of 300 years encountered death.

A similar tale is also in the Giant and Ogre tribes, and the wall is eventually the absolutely inviolable, as its name suggests, "the end wall of the world" is the boundary, which all the races living in the Dark Territory must respect.

It should be ──

"Ah, that, um"

Even though it was expected, Ronye was still largely surprised by the positive answer, so she worked though hard. After having a gulp of tea, somehow she managed to summarize the words.

"......Umm....... So have senpai already tried to cross the wall with your own flying technique?"

"Yup"

However, after nodding, Kirito immediately shook his head.

"I tried and I gave up, neither the aerial sacred art nor the incarnation wind I created was good enough, it seems that the gravity increases indefinitely when approaching an altitude above a certain level ......"

Leaning against the trunk of the olive, Kirito kept on speaking words as if explaining to himself.

"... However, when I threw the knife straight up above the limit, it flew to a considerable height, so it did not refuse to allow all the objects, probably only those being classified as human type, and I tried to manipulate that but I could not change my unit ID even when I grew the wings... All in all, I think the last resort is to be completely sealed in some movable shell. Then we only have to bet on the possibility that the system recognizes that it as entirely non-alive object..."

It was hard to keep up with the story, and Ronye raised her hand.

"That means, though a human of flesh and blood cannot overcome the wall, it may be possible to exceed its height if riding a metal dragon, right?"

"Hmm……?"

Kirito finally raised his face to her and after blinking several times began nodding.

"Oh, sure. Yes, yes, that's right. Actually, I already tried something like leather or paper airplane moved by sacred art or incarnation...... to tie off from a dragon. But it was in vain... It seems the movement of clothes and armor is considered the same as if I myself moved. It is necessary to fly with the power of the dragon. However, it’s a vicious circle because when it comes to resisting the high heat of thermal elements, it inevitably becomes metallic, but then considering the total weight you have to ensure enough power to take off, which increases the number of thermal elements required..."

"Um, ha... it's a difficult thing......."

After thinking a bit in the same direction with Kirito, Ronye suddenly looked back to him.

"No, it’s different! That, what I wanted to ask......"

"And what was it?"

"Why do you want to cross the end wall!

Because I am so long by the side of Kirito-senpai, I know the feelings of senpai who wants to get over if there are walls…... but I think nowadays there are various …… more important things"

Although she felt the need to say that vigorously, she realized that it was more like a sermon, and shrugged her neck. Kirito tapped Ronye’s shoulder lightly.

"Thank you, Ronye. You always worry I don’t think anything wrong."

She laughed and her heart suddenly began to jump. It was hard to hide these feelings from being noticed. Showing no appearance of noticing Ronye’s state, Kirito put his hands to the back of his head and turned his eyes away.

"........... but, I think that crossing that wall is the top priority task in the Underworld now."

"Well... what does that mean?"

"...... Do not tell anyone else, even Tiese and Fanatio."

Suddenly having heard such a thing, she opened her eyes wide but somehow stayed calm.

But truly amazing were words of Kirito that followed.

"── The thing is, the war will start once again."

"............! No, no way ...... The peaceful era has just finally come..."

Drawing a deep sigh, Kirito shook his head with a difficult face.

"I am sorry, but will probably not last for long. ...... The Great Eastern Gate collapsed, the exchange project of two worlds began, and a lot of tourists came from the Dark Territory. Right now, they are enjoying promised landscapes and food. But, everyone will eventually notice. That two worlds have crucial difference."

"A difference...?"

"Ara. Human World's land is so rich and the Dark Territory is awfully poor. You saw it Ronye, that bloody sky and the charcoal black ground....... The only place where they have plenty of rich ground is around the capital city of Obsidia, but humans are exclusively controlling it. Right now, goblins, orks and giants are mostly calmed down again, but dissatisfaction is steadily accumulating. ...... Me and Asuna worked hard to make it possible to plant the territory of sub-people, but it was useless. Spatial resources ...... The supply of sacred power is hopelessly small."

Ronye listened to words of Kirito without a sound.

Indeed, the desolated view of the Dark Territory was burning in her mind. But until now, she never thought about it from such perspective. Not a single idea of how to handle it came to her mind.

"...... Senpai...... I ..."

Kirito’s black eyes met muttering Ronye and he smiled softly.

"I'm sorry, I do not blame Ronye. There is no choice, the Underworld is made from the beginning like that. The only goal is the war between the poor Dark Territory and the rich Human World. And the war began in fact, with so many sacrifices, and we barely avoided the worst ending possible. I will never let the same thing happen again, for the sake of lives lost in that battle."

"But, then, what shall we do ...?"

"There is only one answer. For sub-people, it should not be an inhabitation at the remote boundaries of the Dark Territory that they were inevitably dislodged to, they need a country they can be proud of. Not a land of "sub-people". A real country."

"Real ...... country"

Ronye previously was trying to keep up with the story of Kirito as much as she could, but she felt she could instantaneously understand the clear meaning of those words.

It is only the territory of mountain goblin tribe that Ronye saw with her own eyes. They dwell in hilly areas progressing all the way from the Great Eastern Gate to the northeast. Wheat does not grow in the ground, fish do not live in the water, it is a literal desolation.

Besides, both chieftain Hagashi and his first-born child chief Kosogi fell one after another, and while a new chief was being chosen, the tribal reconstruction hasn’t progressed too well. In the earlier days when the Dark Territory followed only "Law of the Strongest", it would have been destroyed by the giant or the ork tribe, possibly the flat goblin tribe.

Ronye who visited their land following Kirito lost her words to the sight of sick goblins left on the beds of the poor straw and crying weak hungry children. Even if the worst situation is pushed back by a large amount of emergency supplies brought from the Human World, it will not be a fundamental problem resolution. In that land one simply couldn’t support the prolific goblin population in the first place.

But Ronnie did not try to think about their "future" until now. No, she tried to forget them. Figures of goblin children who galling and hitting each other like crazy trying to fetch not so tasty hard-baked breads from her own hands.

_Since then, goods should be continuously sent from the Human World. Maybe once in a while I tell myself that something is wrong, but looking back now I see that in the rich Human World, although I was a lower-class aristocrat, I lived as nobles do without any inconvenience._

But now that she heard words "real country" from Kirito’s mouth, Ronye was forced to comprehend. That wilderness could not be called even a territory, especially a country. That was an exile place. It was such a place that living there itself is punishment.

"............ Senpai...... I ....... I....."

Ronye, deeply depressed, dropped the fork down on the cake dish and muttered with a blurred voice.

_── Nobility has a serious obligation beyond a given privilege. We call that duty of having to fight for those without power at any time, in the sacred word "Noble Obligation"<sup><a href="#Prim7">7</a></sup>._

Two years ago it was Kirito sitting in front of her who taught so Ronye being at that time a first-year student not knowing anything yet.

_── Even so, I forgot it already... no, it is worse. In truth, I did not consider the goblin tribe as equal. Even though I thought that their circumstances are pitiful, somewhere in my heart, even if they are, I didn’t think of helping it...._

First her vision got blurred and then tears fell into a white dish. Tsukigaki turned to her and purred “kurururu” inquiringly but then a hand stretched from the front and combed Ronye’s head.

"I'm sorry, Ronye. I told you this story though I knew you might get hurt."

Instead of his usually gentle voice, Kirito whispered.

"...... However, you do not have to blame yourself so much, because being able to send aid supplies from the Human World to the Dark Territory became only possible after we have stopped wasting of the emperors and the great aristocrats and rapidly recovered after the war. Neither of that could be realized without Ronye's hard work, so Ronye you did your best for them properly."

"Is... that so?"

"Yes, it is. I was to the country of mountain goblins since then, and children remember perfectly even now how you gave them bread."

Again, tears overfilled her eyes and ran down the cheeks, but this time those tears had slightly different meaning. Kirito wiped them with a simple handkerchief.

Ronye desperately resisted the impulse to jump into his chest, to press her face and to cry. Forcibly stopping tears, she lifted her face, smiling a little while leaning on the spot.

"...... Thank you, senpai... It's all right now. I’m sorry, crying like this in the middle of the talk."

"I knew Ronye is a crybaby since you were a first-year trainee."

Watching laughing and smiling Kirito, Ronye sharpened his lips enduring the pain in the back of the chest again.

She finished with tea and after blinking the last tears away opened her mouth.

"...Well, I understood what senpai is thinking. Goblins and orcs need a rich and beautiful country as much as the Human World. No more such places are left in the Underworld, we can only find it on the other side of the "the end wall of the world". For that reason, we must cross the wall with that machine dragon. That's how it is."

"That's right. ... It will be hard even after crossing the wall ..."

Kirito deeply nodded, confirming.

"... But, is there really the other side of the wall? Is that wall not endless, and if not where it runs to.......?"

" I also thought about that... But if that wall really ends up in this world, it feels like it's not even a wall. It is something more like an inaccessible address...... a void."

"Void...... Is it like an emptiness you cannot see or use?"

"Correct. But actually, the end wall of the world is a real cliff. Extremely high and terrible hard. The reason for this is probably to keep the inhabitants of the world from observing the uncomfortable truth.... The real "end of the world". If so, there is a possibility that it stops being "endless" when reaches up there. Everything depends on how much room and spare capacity the main visualizer has......."

Seeing him again flying to areas that the she could not understand, Ronye raised her eyebrows, and Kirito shrugged his head.

"My bad, sorry Ronye, wasn’t talking to you just thinking out loud. Uh, well.... Basically, there is no "end" in this world."

"There is no end ......?"

That was as well an unfamiliar concept to Ronye.

For Ronnie, who was born and grew up in North Centoria, a huge wall that divides the city into sectors — the "timeless wall" — was the beginning. Eventually she learned that the vast Norlangarth empire spreading from it and also learned that it was forming a circular Human World together with the other three empires.

She was taught about the endless mountain range surrounding the Human World and the dreadful territory that is spread far beyond that since she entered her childhood school at the age of eight years.

However, even teachers did not talk about the specifics of the Dark Territory — come to think of it, it is doubtful if they were talking about that at all, — and that there is an endless cliff called “the end wall of the world”, — she only learned after volunteering to Human World defense army together with Tiese and arriving to the camp by the Great Eastern Gate.

In other words, a constant "wall" always existed in the world Ronye knew. Even if one crossed the boundary, the next wall always appeared. This way, she believed, one will someday arrive to the perfect end of the world that they could never overcome.

"....... Well, that is like... ... You mean, on the other side of the end wall, it’s like the Human World and the Dark Territory again?... ... Grasslands, forests and wilderness are spread far and wide?"

As she asked that with an awkward tone, Kirito groaned “ugh…”.

"How can I explain ...? ── Ah, right, come there."

Rising up, he held the hand out. Embarrassed, she took that hand, and Kirito pulled Ronye up and led her to the narrow window open at the outer periphery of the Cloudtop Garden.

"Here, look at that."

The point where his right arm pointed to me was the white semicircle floating in the dark blue eastern sky — Lunaria<sup><a href="#Prim8">8</a></sup>. Both Ronye and Tsukigaki as they were told looked up at the big star that was the source of the name of the young dragon.

Then Kirito said something obvious.

"It’s round, isn’t it?"

"...... Yes, it is round."

She nodded thinking that she meant to answer something.

"That Lunaria is not a flat disk but a round sphere so only the part where sun light hits looks brighter and this way comes waxing and waning... This is taught at the school in Centoria, too?"

Kirito surely looked confident, with a wiggly smile.

"Of course, of course, they tell you at the elementary school, ... that golden orb that is the throne of Goddess Lunaria ... floating in the god kingdom beyond the sky ..."

"Oh, oh, um ... ... actually, I guess this world, including the Human World and the Dark Territory, should be of the same spherical shape."

"Em...... What!? A sphere!?"

She couldn’t help screaming. Suddenly, she felt unwillingly feared and unconsciously stomped on both feet. Next to her Tsukigaki snorted “fururu” as if laughing at stupid Kirito.

Kirito then spent five minutes and taught her about the global spherical structure — the planet, — as he named it. Of course, it was not so easy to accept, but there was something that could help.

The "Morning Star Lookout" on the 95th floor of the Central Cathedral was open to the all the skies around. Standing at that floor, looking at the ground, it was visible that the horizon far away draws a gentle upward arc.

_If the world is truly spherical, — it seems like it is obvious — but when you try to wrap your head around, you start realizing things, thought Ronnie watching Lunaria floating in the sky._

Unexpectedly, words she had never thought of went out from her lips.

"If this world, like Lunaria is a sphere, too ...... on Lunaria, are there grasslands, forests and streets, do people live there?"

"Huh……"

It seemed that it was an unexpected question for Kirito, and a swordsman with long black hair blinked several times, but soon he got his eyes calm again.

"......Maybe ... Depends on the distance to the moon, it may be not a small satellite, it may be a planet of the same size .... Well, someday I will understand it."

Unexpectedly, Ronye did not feel much surprised hearing these amazing words that were uttered quite casually.

Rather, she had a premonition that this person would naturally say so.

So Ronye smiled, just moved closer to Kirito for only one cen and whispered.

"At that time, I will accompany you as well, as a trainee following her senpai."

"You won’t unless we build a big enough machine dragon"

And then two humans and one dragon for quite some time looked up at the semicircle far away in the sky.

8. <a name="Prim8"></a>Interestingly enough, Kawahara uses here normal kanji for the Earth moon, tsuki (月). However, Underworld moon has a special name, just like Solus. In this case, the pronounced name is given as furigana above the kanji 月. To add to this mess, I have to mention that first kanji of “Tsukigaki” is again 月, but even though it’s named by the dwellers of Underworld who has no clue what “tsuki” means, it is still pronounced “Tsukigaki”, not “Lunagaki”. However, again, just like in case of Solus, the name of a goddess comes after the “localized” name, so the goddess of dreams is also called Lunaria.
