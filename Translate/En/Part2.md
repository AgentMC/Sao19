# Part 2

The Central Cathedral fiftieth floor, called the "Great Corridor of the Spiritual Light" was a conference hall for the current "Human World Union Council".

In the middle of the floor where only polished marble was spread, there was a huge round table cut out from an ancient platinum oak, surrounded by twenty chairs.

It was Kirito who sit on one of them shrinking his neck. A large man standing in front of him roared a thunder-like voice.

"Today you shall hear my word, Prime Swordsman-dono<sup><a href="#Prim1">1</a></sup>!"

"............ Yes"

"This time you haven’t destroyed anything! But I swear by my sword, next time you won’t be so fortunate!!"

"………………Yes"

The knight wearing heavy brass armor rebuking him like a teacher was the strongest swordsman in the Human World. His face was the reflection of the term fortitude itself, the hair was short trimmed and his sharp eyes blazed. That was Dusolbert Synthesis Seven, one of the oldest integrity knights.

"Even though Asuna-sama revealed her divine power, the Cathedral from 95th floor is now char black! Although those floors are currently unused, the symbol and landmark of "tower of chalk" became "tower of embers". How much grief and sorrow are the people of the central city suffering! You, Prime Swordsman-dono, must be aware that you are in a position of heavy responsibility which you clearly lack! Having the need for advanced tools or sacred art, you could leave it to a cleric or a blacksmith who have it as their profession!"

A slender knight sitting in a close distance raised from the table to interrupt the Dusolbert’s sermon, which seemed to last forever.

"Let's finish it up, Dusolbert. The Prime Swordsman-dono is already withered like a namekuri<sup><a href="#Prim2">2</a></sup> in the sun."

The owner of glossy voice inducing laughter was a female knight who wore an armor polished like a mirror and had a black hair waving on his back. On the left of her waist there was a slender long sword with a white-silver pattern, and with her right arm she held a small child with indigo hair rare in the Human World.

"But, the knight commander..."

"It is awkward to repeat so much but I’m more afraid if the Prime-dono simply escapes. We don’t have a consultation with the Dark Territory next month."

The name of the woman beautiful as a blooming flower who was called the commander was Fanatio Synthesis Two. She was a person with the world's highest sword power and held the leading position of the Second-Generation Integrity Knights, though it was hard to notice this from her appearance of slowly shaking a sleeping baby.

Fanatio looked directly to Kirito who was still sitting head down and said with a smile.

"That's why, please be quiet for a while, boy."

To that Kirito raised his face a bit wearing a big bitter smile.

"It is much more frightening to be called “boy” than “Prime”."

"He-he, I guess it frightens you because there’s a dark background behind it"

And Fanatio sent a sidelong glance to where there was a figure of Vice-Prime Swordsman Asuna with her arms folded. Although she also smiled, it felt her eyes were a little narrowed.

Then Fanatio also directed the line of sight to Ronye standing next to the pillar away from the round table, smiling a sort of mischievous smile. But immediately she returned her glance back and tapped the Kirito’s shoulder.

"Well, this time there was no actual harm, and I will beg your pardon should there be any further accusations. Instead, I'll do the office exactly until dinner."

"............es"

Having released both shoulders of Kirito and nodded to the each chair around the table, Fanatio again beckoned watching Ronye. The latter quickly came up, and she held out the baby she was holding to her.

"Ronye, I'm sorry but I wonder if you can take care of Berchie. Around this time, if left alone, he will break something."

"Sure, yes, my pleasure!"

Having answered, the knight chief passed on a sleeping baby to the arms of Ronye. She was surprised by the weight felt by her arm. As an integrity knights apprentice, Ronye could swing with one hand both Human World’s weapon or a large two-mel length sword from the Dark Territory, but the weight of a child seemed quite different from that of a weapon.

One-year-old Berchie firmly hugged to her chest with both arms and let out some murmuring, but immediately returned to restful sleep again. She bowed to Fanatio and returned to the wall. Tsukigaki waiting there stretched its nose to smell Berchie and seemed to be interested.

At the round table, Kirito, Asuna, Fanatio, Dusolbert, the head of clerics once used to be a monk and chiefs of various departments of the Cathedral sat around and started a meeting immediately.

"First of all, about the reopening of the mountain range in the Southern cave, which was reported the other day ..."

"Although it is possible to dig a cave, it takes quite a while to build a highway in the southern jungle area ..."
