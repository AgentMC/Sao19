# Part 2

The Central Cathedral fiftieth floor, called the "Great Corridor of the Spiritual Light" was a conference hall for the current "Human World Union Council".

In the middle of the floor where only polished marble was spread, there was a huge round table cut out from an ancient platinum oak, surrounded by twenty chairs.

It was Kirito who sit on one of them shrinking his neck. A large man standing in front of him roared a thunder-like voice.

"Today you shall hear my word, Prime Swordsman-dono<sup><a href="#Prim1">1</a></sup>!"

"............ Yes"

"This time you haven’t destroyed anything! But I swear by my sword, next time you won’t be so fortunate!!"

"………………Yes"

The knight wearing heavy brass armor rebuking him like a teacher was the strongest swordsman in the Human World. His face was the reflection of the term fortitude itself, the hair was short trimmed and his sharp eyes blazed. That was Dusolbert Synthesis Seven, one of the oldest integrity knights.

"Even though Asuna-sama revealed her divine power, the Cathedral from 95th floor is now char black! Although those floors are currently unused, the symbol and landmark of "tower of chalk" became "tower of embers". How much grief and sorrow are the people of the central city suffering! You, Prime Swordsman-dono, must be aware that you are in a position of heavy responsibility which you clearly lack! Having the need for advanced tools or sacred art, you could leave it to a cleric or a blacksmith who have it as their profession!"

A slender knight sitting in a close distance raised from the table to interrupt the Dusolbert’s sermon, which seemed to last forever.

"Let's finish it up, Dusolbert. The Prime Swordsman-dono is already withered like a namekuri<sup><a href="#Prim2">2</a></sup> in the sun."

The owner of glossy voice inducing laughter was a female knight who wore an armor polished like a mirror and had a black hair waving on his back. On the left of her waist there was a slender long sword with a white-silver pattern, and with her right arm she held a small child with indigo hair rare in the Human World.

"But, the knight commander..."

"It is awkward to repeat so much but I’m more afraid if the Prime-dono simply escapes. We don’t have a consultation with the Dark Territory next month."

The name of the woman beautiful as a blooming flower who was called the commander was Fanatio Synthesis Two. She was a person with the world's highest sword power and held the leading position of the Second-Generation Integrity Knights, though it was hard to notice this from her appearance of slowly shaking a sleeping baby.

Fanatio looked directly to Kirito who was still sitting head down and said with a smile.

"That's why, please be quiet for a while, boy."

To that Kirito raised his face a bit wearing a big bitter smile.

"It is much more frightening to be called “boy” than “Prime”."

"He-he, I guess it frightens you because there’s a dark background behind it"

And Fanatio sent a sidelong glance to where there was a figure of Vice-Prime Swordsman Asuna with her arms folded. Although she also smiled, it felt her eyes were a little narrowed.

Then Fanatio also directed the line of sight to Ronye standing next to the pillar away from the round table, smiling a sort of mischievous smile. But immediately she returned her glance back and tapped the Kirito’s shoulder.

"Well, this time there was no actual harm, and I will beg your pardon should there be any further accusations. Instead, I'll do the office exactly until dinner."

"............es"

Having released both shoulders of Kirito and nodded to the each chair around the table, Fanatio again beckoned watching Ronye. The latter quickly came up, and she held out the baby she was holding to her.

"Ronye, I'm sorry but I wonder if you can take care of Berchie. Around this time, if left alone, he will break something."

"Sure, yes, my pleasure!"

Having answered, the knight chief passed on a sleeping baby to the arms of Ronye. She was surprised by the weight felt by her arm. As an integrity knights apprentice, Ronye could swing with one hand both Human World’s weapon or a large two-mel length sword from the Dark Territory, but the weight of a child seemed quite different from that of a weapon.

One-year-old Berchie firmly hugged to her chest with both arms and let out some murmuring, but immediately returned to restful sleep again. She bowed to Fanatio and returned to the wall. Tsukigaki waiting there stretched its nose to smell Berchie and seemed to be interested.

At the round table, Kirito, Asuna, Fanatio, Dusolbert, the head of clerics once used to be a monk and chiefs of various departments of the Cathedral sat around and started a meeting immediately.

"First of all, about the reopening of the mountain range in the Southern cave, which was reported the other day ..."

"Although it is possible to dig a cave, it takes quite a while to build a highway in the southern jungle area ..."

Since that day was not a formal meeting, the knight apprentice Ronye was not obliged to stay in this place. In fact, she was going to join her friend Tiese who was studying in the big library to close the gaps in her sacred art.

But there was something Ronye secretly wanted to ask Kirito. When watching the flight experiment in the morning, she suddenly felt the need to confirm or reject the idea that came into her mind. But since Kirito would flew away as soon as Cathedral staff takes their eyes off him — to shopping streets of Centoria or to some city or village somewhere in the Human World as he has already done when things got rough, she intended to catch him quickly at the end of this meeting.

Training the incarnation, one may keep standing for a few hours with one foot on the top of a thin iron pole, but waiting for the end of this meeting with her back by the pillar was causing more impatience. _But as long as there’s Tsukigaki here, who is by its nature much calmer young dragon than Tiese’s Shimosaki, I won’t get tired of propping the pillar._

While standing still listening to lively discussions, the baby snugly cuddled in her arms suddenly sneezed.

Although it did not appear to wake up, it might be cold so she moved a few steps to bring it in the light of Solus which was falling from a high window. The soft indigo hair glowed and glittered as the sunlight fell on the plump baby face, and Ronye held her breath for a moment to adore its innocent beauty.

_............ Baby......._

She smiled quietly murmuring the word.

But then, her consciousness wandered to memories that couldn’t be said to be very enjoyable, when she returned to a birthplace in the northern part of the capital last month.

***

The Arabel family, from generation to generation, was a family given the 6<sup>th</sup>, lowest ranking in the old aristocratic system.

The life was never wealthy. Without having resources of a senior aristocracy, such as territory, the income was composed of her father’s salary who was the platoon leader in the empire guard and very small baron allowance. As if that’s not enough, there was a tremendous tax every month, far from not only first- or second-class, but not even close to a merchant holding a large store in the center of Centoria.

Still, she spent every day very happy, surrounded by kind and housewifely mother, a strict but friendly father, and a naughty little brother.

The only depressing moment was the occasional party held at her father's birthplace, the house of fourth class aristocrat. Her grandfather, who was a father of four, had been called to heaven by the time Ronye was still a baby, and the eldest son, Ronye’s uncle, the head of a family with insufferable aristocratic temperament ── took over the house. Her gorgeously looking aunt was disgusting when she falsely praised Ronye's mother's old dress and things like that were inevitable so she didn’t want to go at those parties every time.

However, after the “Rebellion of four empires” has been finished, the aristocratic system was greatly reformed. All their land was released. Aristocracy classes were also abolished. Only the soldiers' allowance was left behind, but that alone was not enough and every aristocrat had to get a job at the restructured “human forces army”.

For the former Emperors families, this change was the same as a natural disaster, but if you ask Ronye, it has only become the proper way it should finally be. The era of loud titles and high ranks granted solely because of the origin was over and sword power and intelligence, as well as experience and knowledge, allowed people to take up key positions.

In conclusion, it can be said that now the credit given by state to every aristocrat, was equalized.

But there are a few exceptions.

Specifically, from all the former aristocrats in Centoria, two people were brought into an Integrity Knights apprenticeship: Ronye of the house Arabel, and Tiese of the house Shtolienen.

Last month Ronnie returned to her parents' house for the first time after she became a knight apprentice. Parents and younger brothers whom she hasn’t seen for the whole year were all happy, especially her younger brother, a student of Northern Centoria Sword Masters Academy, who tried to swing Ronye's sword — and could not even draw it — than challenged Ronye to arm-wrestling — and wasn’t able to push in half a cen — which made him terribly excited. Her father asked about the life in Cathedral, her mother's cooking was as delicious as ever, it was a fun night.

The next day, three father's older brothers and their families unexpectedly arrived very early, and they brought plenty of gifts.

In other words, there were marriage proposals to Ronye.

Should Ronye ever be formally entitled Integrity Knight, a guardian from the former Axiom Church, she would be getting overwhelming awe and respect from the entire Human World. These emotions remained almost unchanged even though the Church has been reformed to the “Human World Union Council". It’s even vice-versa, as the number of Integrity Knights have lost their lives in a foreign world war, the appreciation of their heroism has only increased.

If you take such a knight as a bride, the house's status and income will rise at once — and it seemed that her uncle and aunt were thinking this direction. They were from a house of the oldest son. A house of a direct heir. They gathered up a mountain of presents and being proud that they brought so much, they stacked it up in front of Ronye.

_── No matter if I’m the knight apprentice, the most important role of a woman is to give birth and bring up a child. Sure, they say even the head of integrity knights, even that kind of person raises a baby. And there is no law that could say anything is wrong with “my recommendation is my son”, but not like this, not with this person..._

In the past, Kirito secretly told Ronnie and Tiese.

The Highest Priest who ruled the former Axiom Church gathered those who excelled in sword skill and sacred art from all empires and turned them into an integrity knight. However, in fact, knights were deprived from previous memories by the forbidden technique called “The synthesis ritual”, and instead they were given false memories that they were summoned from the divine world.

Of course, it was a terrible act, but standing in front of her uncles and aunts Ronye could not help thinking it was a brilliant idea in terms of streamlining the administration of the Order.

Suppressing her feelings and a wish to create a smoke screen with sacred art and simply escape, Ronye could hardly explain that neither there is a high allowance for the knight, nor a territory for their children. However, her uncle did not try to believe it at all, and finally he became angry saying that Ronye must be luxuriously lavish in Cathedral every day, which made her father angry, so they were finally chased away, and she escaped the danger.

But ──

In her mind, Ronnie could not help thinking _“Thank you Dad”_ and bowing.

_My father told me that I should marry a man who really wanted to marry me, but in his deepest thoughts he must want to see the grandchild's face as soon as possible. No, even before, both father and mother were concerned that their daughter has joined Integrity Knights._ If not for the war, Ronye would normally graduate from the Sword Master Academy, marry some archetypal second or third son or a son-in-law of some low-class aristocrat, following the footsteps of her ancestors from the Arabel family.

That's why it was clear they at least want to have Ronye properly married and given birth to her children.

She would definitely want to fulfil that wish, if she could.

But Ronye had to leave her birthplace and return to Cathedral and apologize many times deep in her heart.

_── I'm sorry, father. Mother. Maybe I will never get married for a lifetime and I won’t have children.  
── Because my feelings will never reach that person._

***

Baby Berchie in her arms woke up and interrupted Ronye's thoughts with a small sob.

Hastily, she gently rocked him with awkward hand movements. But there was no sign of sobs stopping.

"Hey, good boy, good boy."

Though she tried hard to comfort him but the face of the baby instantly dyed red and distorted, ready to transition to crying ─

Just before that, hands stretched from the front and lifted the disgruntled boy.

"He won’t be satisfied with that, this child"

Who was standing there was his mother, the knight commander Fanatio. Smile full of charm on a beautiful face framed with smooth black hair.

"Sail high!"

In other words, she tossed baby Berchie free of support straight up. It was a completely light gesture, but made with the strongest Integrity Knight's strength.

As the child swirled around, it risen high in the air, aiming for the tremendously high ceiling of the “Great Corridor of the Spiritual Light”.

"Nah....... Fuanah...... ah, aboo......!" 

Ronye froze at his strange voice. The boy stopped at the point where he almost touched the ceiling picture depicting gods, and started to fall straight down.

And again, he fell precisely in both hands of his mother. Immediately he started to laugh and make loud joyful sounds.

"Indeed, the future concerns me. Ronye, thanks for looking after him. I will do my best from now on."

Smiling Fanatio left her and headed for the exit. The meeting was already over, so Dusolbert and the heads of departments also followed.

"...... that’s another method of bringing up a kid......"

She heard the whispering voice of amazed Kirito, standing with half a fearful face. Next to him stood Asuna wearing a subtle smile.

"Well, well, as they will become knights and ride the dragons, isn’t it a good thing to be accustomed to high places?"

"With this baby and Scheta’s one, the future seems more and more uncer...... tain, I mean fun."

Shaking his head Kirito put hands on his waist.

"As today's work has been done, I got to take a little look at the state of Unit 2..."

"Oh, uhhhhhhhh? Are you ready for the next one?"

"That one is amazing — there is a fumes compressor between the thermal engine and the thruster, such a turbo......."

"Well, Kirito-kun, I’d say you must be doing something about safety before increasing the power!"

While they were having that conversation where there were more sacred words then normal ones, Ronnie managed to raise her hand.

"Ah, that ....... Sorry, Kirito-senpai ..."

"Hmm?"

"Oh, I, a question...... I have something I'd like to ask......."

Surprised Kirito blinked his black eyes for a moment, but soon gently smiled and nodded.

"Oh, good. Well then, why don’t we have a little early tea. What do you think Asuna?"

At the direction of his line of sight, the Vice-Prime Swordsman raised a voice "Umm".

"I'd like to go out with you, but after this I am supposed to take a sacred art lecture at the big library."

"I see. The second-generation librarians are so scary. It is better not and skip......"

"Only for non-serious students"

Smiling at Kirito and patting him on the back, Asuna went a step away and turned to Ronye.

"Well, at the tea time, Ronye-san, please make sure Kirito does not eat to many sweets"

"I, I understood!"

Ronye lowered her head and glanced at Kirito who babbled something unclear while Asuna walked away leaving a rainbow-colored reflection<sup><a href="#Prim3">3</a></sup>. Kirito waited until her back disappeared in the big southern door and turned around.

"Well then. So, let’s...... haven’t been there for a long time, would you like to go to the 80th floor? And Ronye, I want to have the Yukimomo<sup><a href="#Prim4">4</a></sup> cake."

"Affirmative. I’ll fetch some from the kitchen."

"I’d say best is two... well, better three pieces, well then you get’em and I go ahead!"

Without giving Ronnie a single chance to pinch his mouth, Kirito disappeared in the northern door leading to the lift shaft.

And already from there, he shouted in a loud voice to Ronye, who let her hands fall down onto the neck of Tsukigaki approaching her.

"...It would be better to take the whole thing."
