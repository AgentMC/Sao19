# Part 6

Dawn of the next day, 19th February.

In the huge dragon stables by the western end of Cathedral site, Ronye was stroking the neck of her beloved Tsukigaki again and again.

Young Tsukigaki was making sound of “**Kurururu**”... narrowing the eyes, half from the pleasure, half because it was simply still sleepy. Not only the young dragon, but also Tiese leaning against the silvery fence was sweepingly rocking the red hair. Last night, Ronye thought about going to bed early but could not fall asleep, so she talked to Tiese about a lot of things in the living room.

It is strange that topics for long talks wouldn’t run out even though they were together every day for nearly two years, but her best friend was that kind of person. Kirito and Yujio also had to leave northern Rulid village, traveled to the central capital, entered the Sword Mastery Academy, took years to become Elite Swordsmen, but it was always fun to talk to those two people: about swordsmanship, and fights, and sometimes even sharing the silence was perfectly cozy.

_Now Tiese is at the crossroad of adult life. Whether she accepts the proposal of Integrity Knight Renri, or refuses, I think we can at least remain best friend forever._

"... Well then, Tsukigaki, I’ll go, I guess. Listen carefully to Tiese and be a good boy."

Ronye stood up, and the young dragon lifted his neck and replied "**Kyuru~**".

***

When they finally moved to the arsenal behind Cathedral together with Tiese who finally looked awoken, the Machine Dragon Version 2 was already drawn out to the cobblestone yard.

It was not standing vertically like Version 1, but laid on the ground with three legs, just as it was inside the arsenal. Looking closely, one could see that tips of legs weren’t claws like that of a real dragon but had wheels attached.

Kirito, Asuna, Fanatio, chief of engineering master Sadore were standing close to its head, and there was one more person, a woman of the same age Ronye wearing the arsenal work clothes was standing by the side of a dragon, casting some sacred art with her hand touching the fuselage.

Ronye recognized aerial element generation expression and turned to her friend who stood next holding a bag.

"Hey Tiese, is that girl......."

"Oh, yes, that's her. This young woman was the elevator operator before it has been automated."

"Oh...... she’s cute, is she not?"

"She is, but there is a rumor that this cute girl lives as long as Dusolbert, at least."

"That… that's also true..."

Kirito noticed two people stopped a little away and having a conversation and waved his hand.

"Hey Ronye, Tiese, over here."

"Ah... yes, good morning!"

"Morning!"

They said greetings walking up to him.

Although the sky was still dark, the Machine Dragon Ver. 2 seen outdoors was bigger than she imagined. In addition to having two cockpit seats, left and right wings were elongated to the size of real dragon’s ones, and nozzles in the back were larger as well. The total length would be 40% more than that of Ver. 1, reaching about seven mel.

_Will I ride this? I guess feeling nervous is expected though, but there is no time to show fear as I volunteered myself._

And trying to push the suddenly resurrected in vivid colors image of the last moments of Version 1 out of her mind, she lowered her head again in front of Kirito and Asuna.

"Sorry, we’re late."

"No, it’s still well before the five o'clock."

Kirito answered in a relaxed tone even though it was a while after the bell had rang 4:30 pm, then he got a glance at the new sword on the Ronye’s left waist and smiled.

"Ronye, my escort guard, I kindly ask you to take care of me."

"Ye...... Yes!"

_Even at the cost of my life...._ After she began to reply...... she remembered the words between her and Asuna last night. As a result, she got it out of her mouth.

"I, I will do my best!"

Although it was a childish word, both Kirito and Asuna nodded again with smiles.

They greeted Fanatio and Sadore as well, then she took package from Tiese. Because it was packed up tightly with supplies and clothes a medium-sized bag was pretty heavy, _but should be fine since it’s going to be put into the machine dragon......_ she was thinking.

"Kirito-san, the aerial element charge has been completed"

Having heard such a voice from behind, Ronye and Tiese turned around at the same time. The owner of the voice was a girl who had been previously called an elevator operator; one could say that instead of work clothes of the arsenal or clerics’ robes, an aristocratic dress would more likely to fit her fragile beautiful face.

"Thank you Airy, you saved me."

A girl called Airy to whom Kirito addressed these words bowed without changing a face expression and went by Sadore.

Immediately afterwards, Cathedral's bell gently played the 5 o'clock melody, Kirito clapped hands energetically.

"Well, then, let us be off! Ronye, hand your luggage over here."

She handed the bag that would be her luggage to the stretched-out hand, and Kirito opened a small door on the side of the machine dragon and placed it inside. After seeing it, Ronye firmly hugged Tiese. There was no need to say anything, Ronye's "Well, see you soon" and Tiese’s "Come back safely" thoughts instantly came across between the two of them.

![Image](/Translate/Img/p139.jpg)

As she released the hug, looked at her best friend's face and nodded, Kirito had already moved to the head of the machine dragon. He urged to get up the ladder extending from the ground to the head, and she obeyed; up there she found a small oval room with two chairs: one in front and one in the back.

Because the backrest of the front chair was collapsed, Ronye removed the sword from the waist and squeezed the body behind the chair. Chairs were simple, just leather stretched over the metal frame, but made of highly valuable red horn cow leather rich in flexibility and comfort, so it was overall not as bad as expected.

Kirito immediately came up the ladder after her, returned the back of the front chair to its original angle and sat there. Sadore removed the ladder, then Kirito pulled the handle, the glass canopy came down and closed.

Same moment Ronye’s heart began to pound and she gulped the saliva.

Tsukigaki was still young and couldn’t fly, but there have been many times she was allowed to ride Renri’s  Kazenui<sup><a href="#Prim1">1</a></sup>, Fizel's Himawari and Linel's Hinageshi<sup><a href="#Prim2">2</a></sup>. As expected it was scary for the first one or two times, but the pleasant feeling of flying through the air soon grew above fear. However, she never thought of flying in the sky by herself, or specifically with the artificial dragon made of metal, moreover, flying inside of it rather than riding on the back, so a feeling of incongruity completely engulfed her. _In the first place, there are no wings for flapping, so how would it return to the ground anyway after taking off?_

That moment she again remembered the scene where Version 1 exploded and after calming down her trembling body she asked.

"Ah ... that, Kirito-senpai."

"What's it?"

Ronye bent ahead and asked the Prime Swordsman who returned relaxed voice from the front seat.

"Like the previous dragon, this one releases its thermal energy to fly, right?"

"That's right."

"In the early morning, if you fly in the sky with a loud sound like the one before, won’t people in the capital be surprised and scared...?"

"I guess it could be the case......."

After nodding, Kirito continued in a little difficult to understand words.

"But since the length of the runway is not enough here in the first place, we cannot take off horizontally. Which means, for Version 2 taking off and landing, unfortunately, we’ll have to cheat a bit."

"Chee… cheat...... a... bit...?"

Kirito did not reply to that question but only laughed, and then firmly grasped two metal rods placed in the front of the chair. His hands began to suddenly emit light, and Ronye breathed in.

It was not the light of a sacred art. Kirito's will, directly connected to the matter of the world itself, was visible as light. In other words, it was the radiance of incarnation<sup><a href="#Prim3">3</a></sup>.

The steel dragon shivered like a living thing. Immediately afterwards, the feeling of the body getting lifted away arrived.

Ronye hurriedly looked out through the glass lid. The gray cobblestones and figures Tiese, Asuna and others were slowly moving away. Kirito was lifting the huge machine dragon entirely with the incarnation power.

Watching the ground Ronye was thinking that this was certainly a cheating. As the rising speed increased, the size of those seen outside decreased accordingly. Eventually the white morning haze concealed them, the rose garden spreading north of the arsenal and the white wall of Cathedral occupied the sight.

She put both hands together and looked straight ahead; the dark-blue before dawn sky had spread far and wide. Ronnie lost her words to the beauty of the horizon that was starting to slowly illuminated with red.

When the dragon had risen as high as the large public bath on Cathedral’s ninetieth floor, it stopped the elevation and began to move horizontally. It was quite different from the powerful flapping of the real dragons, more like gliding on the water surface. Nothing else could be heard than a low humming wind noise. This way the citizens of Centoria would not notice them unless they were looking up at the sky at dawn.

But as soon as one concern cleared up, another one came to her head.

"...... Kirito-senpai, will you be fine as you move such a big thing with the power of incarnation?"

After asking the one in the front seat, she panicked if she had disturbed the Kirito’s concentration, but soon the answer was returned with an unchanged tone.

"Well, for a while I will. But it is hard to fly this way as you leave Human World."

"Oh, I see......"

Again, she was amazed by the unrelenting willpower of the Human World Prime Swordsman.

Ronye also practiced as a knight trainee, but not only practical results of "Standing straight on the top of a pillar" which required standing on a thin pillar with one foot, "Controlling the created element" teaching of handling the element created in the air with pure will, but even "Tanza mind emptying" which is basically just sitting on the floor and trying to get rid of all the thoughts — could hardly proceed to the next stage.

Even for the senior knights like Fanatio or Dusolbert, trainings only included secret incarnational techniques like "Arm of Mind" allowing to move things of the size of about a dagger with one’s will and "Blade of Mind" which swings invisible blade, so Kirito's incarnation allowing humans to freely flight a huge machine dragon that carries a human rider was way beyond of normality.

"...... Even with such a strong senpai’s mind power, the "end wall of the world" can still not be crossed...."

When Ronye muttered that, Kirito nodded with a bitter smile.

"Maybe it’s due to a lack of training, but... but it is still meaningless if in the end only I can cross the "wall". In the future it is necessary to set up scheduled flights via large dragons, or make a mechanism like a Cathedral elevator so that all the inhabitants of the Dark Territory... no, entire Underworld can freely come and go."

Ronnie looked out the window, astonished by Kirito's idea of attaching an elevator to the "end wall of the world", height of which was not known to anyone, but she thought she is getting used to this feeling of astonishment.

The machine dragon seemed to have passed through the city of East Centoria unnoticed, and fields and meadows covered with snow that had fallen a while ago spread before her eyes. Although it was still a cold view, wheat will start to grow in March, the ground will be covered with new green.

Ronye had been imagining that view for a while, then asked a new question.

"Oh, senpai...... Even if we cannot go over "end wall of the world" eventually, wouldn’t it be good to have people from Dark Territory moved to Human World? There are a lot of non-cultivated lands in the Human World, I think there is still room to make new fields and villages yet...."

This time, Kirito did not answer for a while.

Eventually, she heard a voice low like a muttering.

"If people of Human World all think like Ronnie......."

"Er... what do you mean...?"

"Hmm....... Well, yes, we currently estimate the total population of Human World around 82,000. Per recent reports, Dark World seems to be about the same. The area of Human World is about 1.77 million square kilolu, since more than a half of them are undeveloped forests and wilderness, certainly Ronye is right, even if the population doubles or becomes even more, there is no problem at all from the land's perspective...... I think."

Among that words, certain information came as a big surprise for Ronye.

"Err....... You say the total population of Dark World is around eighty thousand!? But at the time of a Foreign World War, didn’t emperor Vector prepare as many as fifty thousand army?"

"Do not be surprised like that....... In Dark World, as Fanatio-san says, everyone who can fight should become a soldier, but yeah, I agree at any rate it is a terrible story. However, that is surely the custom of Dark Territory. It's kind of world that you simply cannot survive unless you fight and rob."

Kirito cut off words and put his body to the back of the chair. The concentration of consciousness broke off for a moment, the dragon shook slightly, but then immediately regained stability.

"...and just like in Dark Territory, people of Human World have common mindset built for over 300 years. The inhabitants of Dark Territory are horrible monsters, going across the Mountain Range at the Edge and stealing children and livestock. The flow of tourists and merchants traversing between the two worlds are increasing little by little, but the mindset of people does not change that easily. Even if I try to bind them with a new law or taboo, instinctive fear and disgust will not disappear..."

His voice trembled with deep sadness, and Ronye did not have a good answer.

_Kirito was the one having a power of incarnation enough to float a huge metal dragon, the one defeated Highest Priest Administrator and Dark Territory emperor Vector, but he was never a god. He was a human being — suffering, hesitating, worrying just like me, simply born in a different world.  
Kirito always stood up no matter how bad he got and saved the Underworld from the danger of annihilation; he has not been honored for this officially but he’s still struggling for our world even now. I wish I’d have his strength enough to trying to extend my hand to the far-reaching goal of the harmony between Human World and Dark Territory that nobody could have imagined before_ — but Ronye who was one of the best to imagine the steepness of that road, could not give any advice to him.

Although they came to this topic spontaneously, there would be no way of this sad dialogue occurring should she not accompany him...... but the moment she felt depressed, Kirito said as though he had sensed it.

"I’m glad that Ronye came along. I would be frightened by those children there if it was my first time meeting them."

"Oh ... is that so?"

"It seems, there are various ways rumors take to reach our minds...... but they still remain senseless because we finished the war that way..."

She breathed out lightly, and Kirito said in a different, clear voice as if switching his feelings off.

"Well, now that we’re away from Centoria, let’s switch from incarnational flight to elemental flight."

"Yes, please!"

After nodding vigorously, she asked the front seat.

"Well, what should I do...?"

"Just keep your connection to elements and watch their state like during the first test flight, and please let me know if anything is going to happen."

"I understood!"

Kirito heard Ronye’s voice and showed her thumb up, then grasped two metal bars with both hands. He continued with sacred art initiation phrase.

"System Call, Generate Thermal Element"

Both hands of Kirito glow red and it looked like thermal elements are generated one after another inside hollow metal pipes. They were manipulated by incarnation through the pipe and placed in the sealed can in the middle of the dragon.

It seemed, even for the Prime Swordsman, it was not that easy to simultaneously control the giant dragon and small elements at the same time, as the dragon began to shake again. Suddenly Ronye, not quite realizing what she was doing, bent forward and put her hands onto Kirito’s shoulders.

She did not cast any art, but there was a feeling that the flow of the sacred power spiraling in the surrounding space calmed down a little. The tremor of the dragon decreased and ten thermal elements fit firmly into the sealed can.

"Thank you, Ronye"

Kirito gently tapped Ronye's right hand, slowly breathed in and whispered.

"Discharge"

Hot elements discharged in the sealed can created a tremendously powerful flame.

The flame pushed out from the can to the rear part of the machine dragon driven by its own pressure. In the middle of the way, it mixed with the airstream of aerial elements placed in another can before takeoff, got compressed and blasted out from rear nozzles as a straight torrent much alike to the flame of real dragons.

The intense acceleration pressed Ronye’s body hard against the chair pushing air outside of her lungs.

Clouds drifting outside the window rushed backwards. Comparing only the speed, it was faster when they flew from Central Cathedral to the guards’ office in South Centoria using Kirito's aerial elements flight technique, but the dragon was at that moment under little control of incarnation. In other words, if a high-level cleric trains enough, they could become able to fly as fast as Kirito.

Rather than challenging the "end wall of the world", perhaps, that's more important...... thought Ronye for a moment, as vibrating thunderous roar filled the narrow room. She shouted out loudly holding the frame of the chair hard.

"Se...... senpai! This dragon, how fast is it flying now!?"

"Hmm, let’s see."

Kirito replied with a voice that did not show any tension.

"The highest speed of an Integrity Knight’s dragon is roughly 120 kilolu per hour, and if one has to fly long distances without problems, then you have only about 80 kilolu per hour. But I guess this guy is currently having 250 kilolu per hour..."

"Er...... twi… twice as fast as a real dragon!?"

"I think it can go up to 300 kilolu if I push it down the floor. But I was told by grandpa Sadore to keep around 80% at all times"

While saying that, Kirito pointed to one of several disks lined up in front of his chair. The attached needle certainly trembled slightly before the upper limit of the scale.

"Three… three hundred kilolu in one hour..."

Ronye repeated that shaking her head again and again, trying to comprehend such speed.

_Now I understand, yes, if the machine dragon can fly that fast and far away from the ground ── it would take just half a day to arrive to Obsidia Castle that lies in 3,000 kilometers away. Then, there could also be nobody able to attack such a machine dragon soaring at this ridiculous speed.  
And also, beyond that there’s a huge benefit of…_ thinking in such a way, Ronye finally got used to surrounding rhythmic vibrations.

***

About fifteen hours have passed since they crossed the Mountain Range at the Edge and started flying the red sky of Dark Territory.

Despite they made two breaks, buttocks and backs already began to hurt, but that moment Kirito pointed ahead.

"I see it."

Looking over Kirito's shoulder, she saw a faint light ahead on the ground already covered with darkness. At first it was only a blurred point, but as they got closer it turned into countless lights.

"That is...... the capital of Dark Territory, Obsidia..."

After mumbling so with a hoarse voice, Ronnie asked the Prime Swordsman.

"...... Kirito-senpai, have you been there?"

"Yeah, only once. However, because it was an informal visit, I could hardly see the insides of the castle or the capital city."

"It seems to be alike again this time..."

Ronye's words sounded disappointing, but Kirito turned back and finally laughed.

"No, let alone this time it’s informal, to the degree that we did not even contact Isukan. So, something tells me we’ll have a chance of doing it."

"Something… tells you...?"

She looked outside the window again trying to push down the well-known "bad feeling" that occurred at a considerable frequency when anyone interacted with Kirito.

The machine dragon has reduced the speed to less than half, but still the city light ahead remained somewhat blurred.

Unlike the circularly organized city of Centoria, countless lights were gathered in a shape of a crescent without any regularity. Behind them, a huge black rock rose like a spear.

A lot of lights lit up the rock, because that was the former emperor Vector's castle Obsidia. It seemed that it was dug out in a huge rocky mountain to finally obtain its current castle shape over an enormous number of years, no less than Axiom Church's Central Cathedral ─ so only its outline was visible in the darkness.

"It's about 10 kilolu remaining... All right, it's time to switch to incarnational flight and land."

Surprised with the words of Kirito, Ronnie asked back.

"Why are we going to get off that far?"

"Well, it's going to make a fuss if we go down to the city or castle suddenly with this guy..."

Answering so, Kirito grasped a metal rod that seemed to be a "control stick" and gradually attenuated the thermal elements flame in the sealed can with incarnation. A roaring sound that was filling the small room (which is also officially called "cockpit") became quieter and finally disappeared.

Kirito's incarnation strongly supported the machine dragon which lost propulsion and started to descend. While it was descending, nervousness did not leave Ronye and she was strongly gripping the frame of the chair in both hands.

_When we return to Centoria, I’ll ask them to install a handle to hold on the back of a chair......_ thought Ronye endured a steep falling feeling quite different from one experienced in Cathedral's elevator. Eventually the machine dragon stopped with a small impact, Kirito stretched out greatly in the front seat and said.

"That's it, Ronye. From here we will fly by human power."

***

Two swords, one large and one small bag, a human called Ronye and heavy baggage of one — embracing this all with both his arms, Kirito quickly moved the distance of 10 kilometers by aerial elements flight technique. He mentioned that the limit distance he can fly in a stable way in Dark Territory where spatial sacred power had been sparse, was ten kilolu.

During the flight she was inevitably in close contact with Kirito, so her heart pounded at first, but since the treatment and hanging sideways within his arms was completely the same as those of luggage, the heartburn in her chest could not help being dramatically extinguished.

They landed on the broad road that led to Obsidia castle town. The cobblestone was polished as marble, as in the daytime numerous humans, sub-humans, and carriages were going one after another, but at that time that would probably be after 10 o'clock in the evening there was no shadow there.

As Ronnie was usually in bed by that time, as soon as her feet touched the ground, she was attacked by intense sleepiness coupled with tiredness of a long journey, but shaking her head a lot helped fighting it away. Her escort mission begins from this moment ────

Or, so she thought.

"So, let's look for an accommodation right away."

Kirito told such a thing while fixing the Sword of the Night Sky in the fastening on his left hip, and Ronye repeatedly blinked.

"Well... aren’t we going to the castle?"

"The gate is already closed, and Isukan will also be sleeping soon. If guards find anyone sneaking in at such a time they surely think it is an assassin."

"...... certainly ......"

Although they have traversed all the Underworld to cope with a mysterious murderer who took the life of the inn cleaner Yazen in South Centoria and tried to put the crime on the mountain goblin youth Oroi, if they are mistaken for assassins, it will not be a funny story.

"I understood. But the inn who can accommodate us being Human World humans without any troubles..."

Before answering, Kirito put his hands in his leather bag and took out something small. Looking down to it lit with the city lights, it seemed that it was a small bottle with a lid to keep ointment in.

"Sorry, Ronye, please excuse me..."

While saying this, Kirito opened the lid of the vial and took out the contents with a fingertip. That was the moment she moved her face closer.

"Uni~a!"

Kirito's hand quickly approached and rubbed something sticky over her face, so Ronye screamed. On the face of Ronye, completely frozen because of surprise, Kirito spread the greasy patch with both hands. After passing through the forehead, cheeks, ears and under the chin, Kirito went one step away, looked at Ronye and nodded.

"Yeah, this looks good."

"..............what… is this... thing..?"

She tried rubbing her face with her fingers, but the sticky feeling had disappeared, and nothing was sticking to her fingertips. Kirito did not reply, just once again took out ointment from the vial and painted it on his own face. His skin, averagely white as for a Human World human, even though its color was naturally slightly darker compared with Ronye and Tiese both born in Norlangarth, was dyed in dark black.

In just a few seconds, the face of Kirito turned into a color of kohiru tea<sup><a href="#Prim4">4</a></sup>. It was now of a Southacroith people color, no, even ones of Dark Territory......Thinking that far, she finally realized.

"Ah...... this thing is to disguise us as Dark Territory humans?"

"Yep. Both Ronye’s and mine hair is dark, and its winter now, so I think that it will be impossible to distinguish if we also change the face color."

Listening to that words, Ronye noticed that his face had been colored as well with both hands passing down the cheeks already. As Kirito who glanced at her face said that she was "cool, looking great" with a smiley face, she felt bottom of her palms got hotter.

"Then, senpai, I hop its washable, is it not?"

She asked with a blunt sharp voice, and Kirito hurriedly frowned and nodded.

"Well, of course. Kutokonia-san, a pharmacist, said it would naturally disappear in about eight hours."

"Naturally... what is it made of?"

"It seemed better to not know that."

Having mumbled that last words, Kirito reached out his hands again, corrected Ronye's disturbed hair and turned his eyes to the east.

In Centoria, there was a big gate and a guard room at the border of the city, but it seems that there is not such a thing in Obsidia outskirts, the building number gradually increased on both sides of the road and seemed to continue to the city as is. No guards could be seen.

"...... So far so good, I think, if anyone asks me for identity...... that's right, I came from Faldera to find a job in the northern fu... and let's say we’re brother and sister."

Ronye finally released both hands from cheeks and asked about unfamiliar words in Kirito’s phrase.

"Umm, what is Faldera...?"

"It's a city in the dark world in about 30 kilolu southwest from here."

In truth, she wanted to know the meaning of the 'fu' that he mentioned before part of brother and sister, but enduring curiosity it a lot, Ronnie nodded.

"I understand, let's go, senpai."

She covered head with a hood, took a long sword that has not been assigned a name yet from the top of the bag standing on the stone pavement and hung it on her waist. After that she reached for the bag, but Kirito lifted it a little too soon.

"Ah...... senpai, let me handle my own baggage myself..."

"Oh no, I’m now your brother and you’re my sister. Your brother will bring his sister's luggage."

With a happy smile, Kirito took Ronye's bag in his right hand, hung his leather bag on his left shoulder and started walking. Ronnie bothered her head as to what she should call Kirito when they enter the city and ran after him.
