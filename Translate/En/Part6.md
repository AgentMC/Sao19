# Part 6

Dawn of the next day, 19th February.

In the huge dragon stables by the western end of Cathedral site, Ronye was stroking the neck of her beloved Tsukigaki again and again.

Young Tsukigaki was making sound of “**Kurururu**”... narrowing the eyes, half from the pleasure, half because it was simply still sleepy. Not only the young dragon, but also Tiese leaning against the silvery fence was sweepingly rocking the red hair. Last night, Ronye thought about going to bed early but could not fall asleep, so she talked to Tiese about a lot of things in the living room.

It is strange that topics for long talks wouldn’t run out even though they were together every day for nearly two years, but her best friend was that kind of person. Kirito and Yujio also had to leave northern Rulid village, traveled to the central capital, entered the Sword Mastery Academy, took years to become Elite Swordsmen, but it was always fun to talk to those two people: about swordsmanship, and fights, and sometimes even sharing the silence was perfectly cozy.

_Now Tiese is at the crossroad of adult life. Whether she accepts the proposal of Integrity Knight Renri, or refuses, I think we can at least remain best friend forever._

"... Well then, Tsukigaki, I’ll go, I guess. Listen carefully to Tiese and be a good boy."

Ronye stood up, and the young dragon lifted his neck and replied "**Kyuru~**".

***

When they finally moved to the arsenal behind Cathedral together with Tiese who finally looked awoken, the Machine Dragon Version 2 was already drawn out to the cobblestone yard.

It was not standing vertically like Version 1, but laid on the ground with three legs, just as it was inside the arsenal. Looking closely, one could see that tips of legs weren’t claws like that of a real dragon but had wheels attached.

Kirito, Asuna, Fanatio, chief of engineering master Sadore were standing close to its head, and there was one more person, a woman of the same age Ronye wearing the arsenal work clothes was standing by the side of a dragon, casting some sacred art with her hand touching the fuselage.

Ronye recognized aerial element generation expression and turned to her friend who stood next holding a bag.

"Hey Tiese, is that girl......."

"Oh, yes, that's her. This young woman was the elevator operator before it has been automated."

"Oh...... she’s cute, is she not?"

"She is, but there is a rumor that this cute girl lives as long as Dusolbert, at least."

"That… that's also true..."

Kirito noticed two people stopped a little away and having a conversation and waved his hand.

"Hey Ronye, Tiese, over here."

"Ah... yes, good morning!"

"Morning!"

They said greetings walking up to him.

Although the sky was still dark, the Machine Dragon Ver. 2 seen outdoors was bigger than she imagined. In addition to having two cockpit seats, left and right wings were elongated to the size of real dragon’s ones, and nozzles in the back were larger as well. The total length would be 40% more than that of Ver. 1, reaching about seven mel.

_Will I ride this? I guess feeling nervous is expected though, but there is no time to show fear as I volunteered myself._

And trying to push the suddenly resurrected in vivid colors image of the last moments of Version 1 out of her mind, she lowered her head again in front of Kirito and Asuna.

"Sorry, we’re late."

"No, it’s still well before the five o'clock."

Kirito answered in a relaxed tone even though it was a while after the bell had rang 4:30 pm, then he got a glance at the new sword on the Ronye’s left waist and smiled.

"Ronye, my escort guard, I kindly ask you to take care of me."

"Ye...... Yes!"

_Even at the cost of my life...._ After she began to reply...... she remembered the words between her and Asuna last night. As a result, she got it out of her mouth.

"I, I will do my best!"

Although it was a childish word, both Kirito and Asuna nodded again with smiles.

They greeted Fanatio and Sadore as well, then she took package from Tiese. Because it was packed up tightly with supplies and clothes a medium-sized bag was pretty heavy, _but should be fine since it’s going to be put into the machine dragon......_ she was thinking.

"Kirito-san, the aerial element charge has been completed"

Having heard such a voice from behind, Ronye and Tiese turned around at the same time. The owner of the voice was a girl who had been previously called an elevator operator; one could say that instead of work clothes of the arsenal or clerics’ robes, an aristocratic dress would more likely to fit her fragile beautiful face.

"Thank you Airy, you saved me."

A girl called Airy to whom Kirito addressed these words bowed without changing a face expression and went by Sadore.

Immediately afterwards, Cathedral's bell gently played the 5 o'clock melody, Kirito clapped hands energetically.

"Well, then, let us be off! Ronye, hand your luggage over here."

She handed the bag that would be her luggage to the stretched-out hand, and Kirito opened a small door on the side of the machine dragon and placed it inside. After seeing it, Ronye firmly hugged Tiese. There was no need to say anything, Ronye's "Well, see you soon" and Tiese’s "Come back safely" thoughts instantly came across between the two of them.

![Image](/Translate/Img/p139.jpg)

As she released the hug, looked at her best friend's face and nodded, Kirito had already moved to the head of the machine dragon. He urged to get up the ladder extending from the ground to the head, and she obeyed; up there she found a small oval room with two chairs: one in front and one in the back.

Because the backrest of the front chair was collapsed, Ronye removed the sword from the waist and squeezed the body behind the chair. Chairs were simple, just leather stretched over the metal frame, but made of highly valuable red horn cow leather rich in flexibility and comfort, so it was overall not as bad as expected.

Kirito immediately came up the ladder after her, returned the back of the front chair to its original angle and sat there. Sadore removed the ladder, then Kirito pulled the handle, the glass canopy came down and closed.

Same moment Ronye’s heart began to pound and she gulped the saliva.

Tsukigaki was still young and couldn’t fly, but there have been many times she was allowed to ride Renri’s  Kazenui<sup><a href="#Prim1">1</a></sup>, Fizel's Himawari and Linel's Hinageshi<sup><a href="#Prim2">2</a></sup>. As expected it was scary for the first one or two times, but the pleasant feeling of flying through the air soon grew above fear. However, she never thought of flying in the sky by herself, or specifically with the artificial dragon made of metal, moreover, flying inside of it rather than riding on the back, so a feeling of incongruity completely engulfed her. _In the first place, there are no wings for flapping, so how would it return to the ground anyway after taking off?_

That moment she again remembered the scene where Version 1 exploded and after calming down her trembling body she asked.

"Ah ... that, Kirito-senpai."

"What's it?"

Ronye bent ahead and asked the Prime Swordsman who returned relaxed voice from the front seat.

"Like the previous dragon, this one releases its thermal energy to fly, right?"

"That's right."

"In the early morning, if you fly in the sky with a loud sound like the one before, won’t people in the capital be surprised and scared...?"

"I guess it could be the case......."

After nodding, Kirito continued in a little difficult to understand words.

"But since the length of the runway is not enough here in the first place, we cannot take off horizontally. Which means, for Version 2 taking off and landing, unfortunately, we’ll have to cheat a bit."

"Chee… cheat...... a... bit...?"

Kirito did not reply to that question but only laughed, and then firmly grasped two metal rods placed in the front of the chair. His hands began to suddenly emit light, and Ronye breathed in.

It was not the light of a sacred art. Kirito's will, directly connected to the matter of the world itself, was visible as light. In other words, it was the radiance of incarnation<sup><a href="#Prim3">3</a></sup>.

The steel dragon shivered like a living thing. Immediately afterwards, the feeling of the body getting lifted away arrived.

Ronye hurriedly looked out through the glass lid. The gray cobblestones and figures Tiese, Asuna and others were slowly moving away. Kirito was lifting the huge machine dragon entirely with the incarnation power.

Watching the ground Ronye was thinking that this was certainly a cheating. As the rising speed increased, the size of those seen outside decreased accordingly. Eventually the white morning haze concealed them, the rose garden spreading north of the arsenal and the white wall of Cathedral occupied the sight.

She put both hands together and looked straight ahead; the dark-blue before dawn sky had spread far and wide. Ronnie lost her words to the beauty of the horizon that was starting to slowly illuminated with red.

When the dragon had risen as high as the large public bath on Cathedral’s ninetieth floor, it stopped the elevation and began to move horizontally. It was quite different from the powerful flapping of the real dragons, more like gliding on the water surface. Nothing else could be heard than a low humming wind noise. This way the citizens of Centoria would not notice them unless they were looking up at the sky at dawn.

But as soon as one concern cleared up, another one came to her head.

"...... Kirito-senpai, will you be fine as you move such a big thing with the power of incarnation?"

After asking the one in the front seat, she panicked if she had disturbed the Kirito’s concentration, but soon the answer was returned with an unchanged tone.

"Well, for a while I will. But it is hard to fly this way as you leave Human World."

"Oh, I see......"

Again, she was amazed by the unrelenting willpower of the Human World Prime Swordsman.

Ronye also practiced as a knight trainee, but not only practical results of "Standing straight on the top of a pillar" which required standing on a thin pillar with one foot, "Controlling the created element" teaching of handling the element created in the air with pure will, but even "Tanza mind emptying" which is basically just sitting on the floor and trying to get rid of all the thoughts — could hardly proceed to the next stage.

Even for the senior knights like Fanatio or Dusolbert, trainings only included secret incarnational techniques like "Arm of Mind" allowing to move things of the size of about a dagger with one’s will and "Blade of Mind" which swings invisible blade, so Kirito's incarnation allowing humans to freely flight a huge machine dragon that carries a human rider was way beyond of normality.

"...... Even with such a strong senpai’s mind power, the "end wall of the world" can still not be crossed...."

When Ronye muttered that, Kirito nodded with a bitter smile.

"Maybe it’s due to a lack of training, but... but it is still meaningless if in the end only I can cross the "wall". In the future it is necessary to set up scheduled flights via large dragons, or make a mechanism like a Cathedral elevator so that all the inhabitants of the Dark Territory... no, entire Underworld can freely come and go."

Ronnie looked out the window, astonished by Kirito's idea of attaching an elevator to the "end wall of the world", height of which was not known to anyone, but she thought she is getting used to this feeling of astonishment.

The machine dragon seemed to have passed through the city of East Centoria unnoticed, and fields and meadows covered with snow that had fallen a while ago spread before her eyes. Although it was still a cold view, wheat will start to grow in March, the ground will be covered with new green.

Ronye had been imagining that view for a while, then asked a new question.

"Oh, senpai...... Even if we cannot go over "end wall of the world" eventually, wouldn’t it be good to have people from Dark Territory moved to Human World? There are a lot of non-cultivated lands in the Human World, I think there is still room to make new fields and villages yet...."

This time, Kirito did not answer for a while.

Eventually, she heard a voice low like a muttering.

"If people of Human World all think like Ronnie......."

"Er... what do you mean...?"

"Hmm....... Well, yes, we currently estimate the total population of Human World around 82,000. Per recent reports, Dark World seems to be about the same. The area of Human World is about 1.77 million square kilolu, since more than a half of them are undeveloped forests and wilderness, certainly Ronye is right, even if the population doubles or becomes even more, there is no problem at all from the land's perspective...... I think."

Among that words, certain information came as a big surprise for Ronye.

"Err....... You say the total population of Dark World is around eighty thousand!? But at the time of a Foreign World War, didn’t emperor Vector prepare as many as fifty thousand army?"

"Do not be surprised like that....... In Dark World, as Fanatio-san says, everyone who can fight should become a soldier, but yeah, I agree at any rate it is a terrible story. However, that is surely the custom of Dark Territory. It's kind of world that you simply cannot survive unless you fight and rob."

Kirito cut off words and put his body to the back of the chair. The concentration of consciousness broke off for a moment, the dragon shook slightly, but then immediately regained stability.

"...and just like in Dark Territory, people of Human World have common mindset built for over 300 years. The inhabitants of Dark Territory are horrible monsters, going across the Mountain Range at the Edge and stealing children and livestock. The flow of tourists and merchants traversing between the two worlds are increasing little by little, but the mindset of people does not change that easily. Even if I try to bind them with a new law or taboo, instinctive fear and disgust will not disappear..."

His voice trembled with deep sadness, and Ronye did not have a good answer.

_Kirito was the one having a power of incarnation enough to float a huge metal dragon, the one defeated Highest Priest Administrator and Dark Territory emperor Vector, but he was never a god. He was a human being — suffering, hesitating, worrying just like me, simply born in a different world.  
Kirito always stood up no matter how bad he got and saved the Underworld from the danger of annihilation; he has not been honored for this officially but he’s still struggling for our world even now. I wish I’d have his strength enough to trying to extend my hand to the far-reaching goal of the harmony between Human World and Dark Territory that nobody could have imagined before_ — but Ronye who was one of the best to imagine the steepness of that road, could not give any advice to him.

Although they came to this topic spontaneously, there would be no way of this sad dialogue occurring should she not accompany him...... but the moment she felt depressed, Kirito said as though he had sensed it.

"I’m glad that Ronye came along. I would be frightened by those children there if it was my first time meeting them."

"Oh ... is that so?"

"It seems, there are various ways rumors take to reach our minds...... but they still remain senseless because we finished the war that way..."

She breathed out lightly, and Kirito said in a different, clear voice as if switching his feelings off.

"Well, now that we’re away from Centoria, let’s switch from incarnational flight to elemental flight."

"Yes, please!"

After nodding vigorously, she asked the front seat.

"Well, what should I do...?"

"Just keep your connection to elements and watch their state like during the first test flight, and please let me know if anything is going to happen."

"I understood!"

Kirito heard Ronye’s voice and showed her thumb up, then grasped two metal bars with both hands. He continued with sacred art initiation phrase.

"System Call, Generate Thermal Element"

Both hands of Kirito glow red and it looked like thermal elements are generated one after another inside hollow metal pipes. They were manipulated by incarnation through the pipe and placed in the sealed can in the middle of the dragon.

It seemed, even for the Prime Swordsman, it was not that easy to simultaneously control the giant dragon and small elements at the same time, as the dragon began to shake again. Suddenly Ronye, not quite realizing what she was doing, bent forward and put her hands onto Kirito’s shoulders.

She did not cast any art, but there was a feeling that the flow of the sacred power spiraling in the surrounding space calmed down a little. The tremor of the dragon decreased and ten thermal elements fit firmly into the sealed can.

"Thank you, Ronye"

Kirito gently tapped Ronye's right hand, slowly breathed in and whispered.

"Discharge"

Hot elements discharged in the sealed can created a tremendously powerful flame.

The flame pushed out from the can to the rear part of the machine dragon driven by its own pressure. In the middle of the way, it mixed with the airstream of aerial elements placed in another can before takeoff, got compressed and blasted out from rear nozzles as a straight torrent much alike to the flame of real dragons.

The intense acceleration pressed Ronye’s body hard against the chair pushing air outside of her lungs.

Clouds drifting outside the window rushed backwards. Comparing only the speed, it was faster when they flew from Central Cathedral to the guards’ office in South Centoria using Kirito's aerial elements flight technique, but the dragon was at that moment under little control of incarnation. In other words, if a high-level cleric trains enough, they could become able to fly as fast as Kirito.

Rather than challenging the "end wall of the world", perhaps, that's more important...... thought Ronye for a moment, as vibrating thunderous roar filled the narrow room. She shouted out loudly holding the frame of the chair hard.

"Se...... senpai! This dragon, how fast is it flying now!?"

"Hmm, let’s see."

Kirito replied with a voice that did not show any tension.

"The highest speed of an Integrity Knight’s dragon is roughly 120 kilolu per hour, and if one has to fly long distances without problems, then you have only about 80 kilolu per hour. But I guess this guy is currently having 250 kilolu per hour..."

"Er...... twi… twice as fast as a real dragon!?"

"I think it can go up to 300 kilolu if I push it down the floor. But I was told by grandpa Sadore to keep around 80% at all times"

While saying that, Kirito pointed to one of several disks lined up in front of his chair. The attached needle certainly trembled slightly before the upper limit of the scale.

"Three… three hundred kilolu in one hour..."

Ronye repeated that shaking her head again and again, trying to comprehend such speed.

_Now I understand, yes, if the machine dragon can fly that fast and far away from the ground ── it would take just half a day to arrive to Obsidia Castle that lies in 3,000 kilometers away. Then, there could also be nobody able to attack such a machine dragon soaring at this ridiculous speed.  
And also, beyond that there’s a huge benefit of…_ thinking in such a way, Ronye finally got used to surrounding rhythmic vibrations.

***

About fifteen hours have passed since they crossed the Mountain Range at the Edge and started flying the red sky of Dark Territory.

Despite they made two breaks, buttocks and backs already began to hurt, but that moment Kirito pointed ahead.

"I see it."

Looking over Kirito's shoulder, she saw a faint light ahead on the ground already covered with darkness. At first it was only a blurred point, but as they got closer it turned into countless lights.

"That is...... the capital of Dark Territory, Obsidia..."

After mumbling so with a hoarse voice, Ronnie asked the Prime Swordsman.

"...... Kirito-senpai, have you been there?"

"Yeah, only once. However, because it was an informal visit, I could hardly see the insides of the castle or the capital city."

"It seems to be alike again this time..."

Ronye's words sounded disappointing, but Kirito turned back and finally laughed.

"No, let alone this time it’s informal, to the degree that we did not even contact Isukan. So, something tells me we’ll have a chance of doing it."

"Something… tells you...?"

She looked outside the window again trying to push down the well-known "bad feeling" that occurred at a considerable frequency when anyone interacted with Kirito.

The machine dragon has reduced the speed to less than half, but still the city light ahead remained somewhat blurred.

Unlike the circularly organized city of Centoria, countless lights were gathered in a shape of a crescent without any regularity. Behind them, a huge black rock rose like a spear.

A lot of lights lit up the rock, because that was the former emperor Vector's castle Obsidia. It seemed that it was dug out in a huge rocky mountain to finally obtain its current castle shape over an enormous number of years, no less than Axiom Church's Central Cathedral ─ so only its outline was visible in the darkness.

"It's about 10 kilolu remaining... All right, it's time to switch to incarnational flight and land."

Surprised with the words of Kirito, Ronnie asked back.

"Why are we going to get off that far?"

"Well, it's going to make a fuss if we go down to the city or castle suddenly with this guy..."

Answering so, Kirito grasped a metal rod that seemed to be a "control stick" and gradually attenuated the thermal elements flame in the sealed can with incarnation. A roaring sound that was filling the small room (which is also officially called "cockpit") became quieter and finally disappeared.

Kirito's incarnation strongly supported the machine dragon which lost propulsion and started to descend. While it was descending, nervousness did not leave Ronye and she was strongly gripping the frame of the chair in both hands.

_When we return to Centoria, I’ll ask them to install a handle to hold on the back of a chair......_ thought Ronye endured a steep falling feeling quite different from one experienced in Cathedral's elevator. Eventually the machine dragon stopped with a small impact, Kirito stretched out greatly in the front seat and said.

"That's it, Ronye. From here we will fly by human power."

***

Two swords, one large and one small bag, a human called Ronye and heavy baggage of one — embracing this all with both his arms, Kirito quickly moved the distance of 10 kilometers by aerial elements flight technique. He mentioned that the limit distance he can fly in a stable way in Dark Territory where spatial sacred power had been sparse, was ten kilolu.

During the flight she was inevitably in close contact with Kirito, so her heart pounded at first, but since the treatment and hanging sideways within his arms was completely the same as those of luggage, the heartburn in her chest could not help being dramatically extinguished.

They landed on the broad road that led to Obsidia castle town. The cobblestone was polished as marble, as in the daytime numerous humans, sub-humans, and carriages were going one after another, but at that time that would probably be after 10 o'clock in the evening there was no shadow there.

As Ronnie was usually in bed by that time, as soon as her feet touched the ground, she was attacked by intense sleepiness coupled with tiredness of a long journey, but shaking her head a lot helped fighting it away. Her escort mission begins from this moment ────

Or, so she thought.

"So, let's look for an accommodation right away."

Kirito told such a thing while fixing the Sword of the Night Sky in the fastening on his left hip, and Ronye repeatedly blinked.

"Well... aren’t we going to the castle?"

"The gate is already closed, and Isukan will also be sleeping soon. If guards find anyone sneaking in at such a time they surely think it is an assassin."

"...... certainly ......"

Although they have traversed all the Underworld to cope with a mysterious murderer who took the life of the inn cleaner Yazen in South Centoria and tried to put the crime on the mountain goblin youth Oroi, if they are mistaken for assassins, it will not be a funny story.

"I understood. But the inn who can accommodate us being Human World humans without any troubles..."

Before answering, Kirito put his hands in his leather bag and took out something small. Looking down to it lit with the city lights, it seemed that it was a small bottle with a lid to keep ointment in.

"Sorry, Ronye, please excuse me..."

While saying this, Kirito opened the lid of the vial and took out the contents with a fingertip. That was the moment she moved her face closer.

"Uni~a!"

Kirito's hand quickly approached and rubbed something sticky over her face, so Ronye screamed. On the face of Ronye, completely frozen because of surprise, Kirito spread the greasy patch with both hands. After passing through the forehead, cheeks, ears and under the chin, Kirito went one step away, looked at Ronye and nodded.

"Yeah, this looks good."

"..............what… is this... thing..?"

She tried rubbing her face with her fingers, but the sticky feeling had disappeared, and nothing was sticking to her fingertips. Kirito did not reply, just once again took out ointment from the vial and painted it on his own face. His skin, averagely white as for a Human World human, even though its color was naturally slightly darker compared with Ronye and Tiese both born in Norlangarth, was dyed in dark black.

In just a few seconds, the face of Kirito turned into a color of kohiru tea<sup><a href="#Prim4">4</a></sup>. It was now of a Southacroith people color, no, even ones of Dark Territory......Thinking that far, she finally realized.

"Ah...... this thing is to disguise us as Dark Territory humans?"

"Yep. Both Ronye’s and mine hair is dark, and its winter now, so I think that it will be impossible to distinguish if we also change the face color."

Listening to that words, Ronye noticed that his face had been colored as well with both hands passing down the cheeks already. As Kirito who glanced at her face said that she was "cool, looking great" with a smiley face, she felt bottom of her palms got hotter.

"Then, senpai, I hop its washable, is it not?"

She asked with a blunt sharp voice, and Kirito hurriedly frowned and nodded.

"Well, of course. Kutokonia-san, a pharmacist, said it would naturally disappear in about eight hours."

"Naturally... what is it made of?"

"It seemed better to not know that."

Having mumbled that last words, Kirito reached out his hands again, corrected Ronye's disturbed hair and turned his eyes to the east.

In Centoria, there was a big gate and a guard room at the border of the city, but it seems that there is not such a thing in Obsidia outskirts, the building number gradually increased on both sides of the road and seemed to continue to the city as is. No guards could be seen.

"...... So far so good, I think, if anyone asks me for identity...... that's right, I came from Faldera to find a job in the northern fu... and let's say we’re brother and sister."

Ronye finally released both hands from cheeks and asked about unfamiliar words in Kirito’s phrase.

"Umm, what is Faldera...?"

"It's a city in the dark world in about 30 kilolu southwest from here."

In truth, she wanted to know the meaning of the 'fu' that he mentioned before part of brother and sister, but enduring curiosity it a lot, Ronnie nodded.

"I understand, let's go, senpai."

She covered head with a hood, took a long sword that has not been assigned a name yet from the top of the bag standing on the stone pavement and hung it on her waist. After that she reached for the bag, but Kirito lifted it a little too soon.

"Ah...... senpai, let me handle my own baggage myself..."

"Oh no, I’m now your brother and you’re my sister. Your brother will bring his sister's luggage."

With a happy smile, Kirito took Ronye's bag in his right hand, hung his leather bag on his left shoulder and started walking. Ronnie bothered her head as to what she should call Kirito when they enter the city and ran after him.

***

After they had walked for a while in the late-night road, the surroundings gradually became bright, and at the same time the number of people and the sub-people passing by increased, so Ronye felt relief and tension at the same time.

The Obsidia Castle Town which she saw for the first time, had most buildings made of dark stone, there were fewer trees and waterside, and it generally had a crowded feeling compared to Centoria. However, lanterns attached to the walls of the houses and pillars along the road had red, yellow and purple lights in spite of late night, so there was something like a festival atmosphere.

"What is burning in those lanterns?"

Kirito immediately answered Ronye's question.

"It's an ore that can be found in nearby mountains, it seems that a piece of a fist size will keep burning for ten days."

"Well, that's useful, is not it?"

"You would think that it could be sold at a high price if anyone brings it to Human World, but handling it is troublesome because it starts to burn naturally unless it is submerged in water, so it is quite difficult to transport long distances..."

They walked ahead having such a conversation and eventually a place of a lively atmosphere appeared in the front. There was a small square, with numerous tents around, and many people were drinking having surrounded tables lined in the center.

About half of them were humans with the dark skin, and there were not a few orks and goblins, but they occupied another table. _Even after the "Peace Treaty of the Five Peoples" was supposed to have been concluded in Dark Territory, the confrontation between tribes has not yet disappeared..._, thought Ronye peeking from behind of Kirito’s head, but he told her.

"Hey, just being drinking in the same place is a big change already. Look, that fist-fighter and a group of orks are talking to each other at neighboring tables, aren’t they?"

"Oh, that’s true, it seems they are toasting......."

When a fist fighter who barely covered his sturdy upper body, even though it was February, protruded a wooden jug screaming something, an ork sitting next to him vigorously hit his mug. Watching this situation from the square entrance, Ronye muttered as if continue her monologue of thoughts.

"During the Foreign World War, the orc forces came to rescue an almost wiped out fist fighter group....... The "green swordsman" who led it, orcs are exalting her like a goddess."

Ronye never met her, but she knew that the "green swordsman Leafa" who disappeared with the finish of the war was Kirito's sister from real world. Kirito’s painted dark face distorted as if he considered to cut it off for a moment but soon he returned to his usual expression and nodded.

"Yes...... It was the reason why we were able to get that treaty with Dark Territory so quickly, all thanks to Leafa without any exaggeration. That's why, we must protect this peace at all costs."

"……Yes"

Ronnie answered realizing that each time he tried to forget, that fundamental anxiety was waking him up like everlasting waves.

It didn’t take long though before Kirito continued in a normal way.

"Well, it's a bit late but let us have some too. I’m never tired of street food."

"Oh... are we going to eat here?"

"Look, it is such a delicious smell from all the tents...... Enduring it would be as hard as an everyday anger of both Fanatio-san and Dusolbert-san."

Kirito grabbed the bag and stepped in to the square after saying something that did feel like a theory.

Unavoidably she followed him, and the fragrant smell immediately tickled her nose reminding her of hunger. There were six tents over the outer row, but from the first glance it wasn’t clear which one is selling what.

At times like this one, when Ronye was hard to make a choice, she relied on Tiese who quickly decided...... normally, but there was no her redhead friend next to her. Neither could she trust the taste of Prime Swordsman who was muttering "That’s skewer grill, it's tasty......but it's such a time already, maybe to take that noodle soup they prepare over there......no, no, the buns on the other side are quite..." going from one tent to another.

_By the way, it was Yujio-senpai who usually decided for Kirito-senpai so no surprise he got lost......_ After she noticed that and smiled a little, Ronye pulled the cloak of Kirito.

"Oh, senpai... Before we eat, do you have local money in the first place?"

"............"

The face of Kirito looking at Ronye was gradually changing from startle to despair.

There were four kinds of money circulating in Human World: thousand shear golden coins, hundred shear silver coins, ten shear copper coins and one shear iron coins. Strictly speaking there were also ten thousand shear white gold coins, but they were not spread among general people and lower aristocrats because they were only used for transactions between the government and biggest merchants.

For Ronye, it had always been shear coins all the time she could remember, but since it bore the profile of goddess Stacia and an emblem of Axiom Church, it could not be used in Dark Territory. Of course, separate money should exist here.

Kirito seemed to have finally realized the situation because he dropped his shoulders and said.

"......You know, in the Cathedral we don’t use money, so I completely forgot......."

"Are...... are you saying that you have not brought a single shear with you... or ...?"

Looking like a child scolded by a teacher, Kirito nodded.

Ronye had no idea what to say, and she could only look at the face of Prime Swordsman for several moments.

In the back of the sword belt that Ronye always wore, there was a thousand shear golden coin sewn for a case of a need but there was no use to it in this town anyway. She realized there was a further problem and asked Kirito again.

"Well, does it mean we cannot stay in the inn...?"

"Umm, well, looks like that."

Ronye deeply sighed closely to being for unknown reason gravely positive Prime Swordsman.

"And if we have got stayed penniless, how were we going to pay exactly?"

"Well, you know, sharing automatically from the storage......."<sup><a href="#Prim5">5</a></sup>

Kirito stared at tents with a such face as if he had not given up even in these circumstances, and finally looked up at the gigantic castle piercing through the night sky.

"It cannot be helped, let’s pray that Isukan is still awake and sneak into Obsidia castle......"

── said her senpai who mentioned a moment earlier that it would be tough if they got treated as assassins!

Ronye breathed in heavily to express in words all she was thinking about this idea, and that time.

Above two whispering heads in the corner of the square that came so close that almost touched each other, a big human figure emerged.

"...... !?"

Ronye raised her face, restraining her hands from stretching to the sword on the left hip. It was a giant standing in front of them, as tall as one mel and ninety cen<sup><a href="#Prim6">6</a></sup>.

Rugged muscles covered the naked upper body crossed with leather bands and countless old wounds running across red copper skin proved him being a fist fighter. The pale light of a lantern was not enough to understand whether he is drunk that much, or is it his face beneath stiff hair simply naturally red enough.

"Hey bro<sup><a href="#Prim7">7</a></sup>, got no money to eat?"

At least hostility was not felt in his voice, so Ronye ceased the alertness a little. On the other hand, Kirito nodding with a miserable look, with a voice that seemed to be very hungry ─ he might not be acting but behaving as he was though ─ answered.

"Well...... Yes, that's right. I came to find a job with my sister from Faldera, but ran out of it on the way."

"Huh, Faldera is big, my old man is still over there."

Listening to the word of the giant, Ronye chilled to the liver as it would be quite hard to start talking about memories of the city only known by name, but fortunately it did not develop that way. Fist fighter slammed Kirito's shoulder with a thick and heavy right hand as if fitted with leather gloves, and said generous thing.

"Yeah, lemme give a treat to fellow countryman."

"I, no, ...I'm kind of going…"

Already regretting his acting, Kirito tried to refuse, but fist fighter pushed his back to the corner of the square. Kirito moved his legs reluctantly, and Ronye followed.

It was the smallest and the most dimly-lit place among the six houses that the fist fighter led them to. The only thing that can be said for sure about the shopkeeper stirring a large pan of seasoning with a long ladle, with the majority of his face hidden with growing forelock, was that he is a human. The faded cloth hanging from the counter’s eaves’ corner bore the writing "Obsidia boil" with wry small letters, apparently it was the name of a dish.

"This place is the best in this square. Well, even though nobody of my friends agree!"

The drunk fist fighter laughed “**ga-ha-ha**”, and Kirito attempted to retract with a face full of horror.

"Ah, that, uncle, I have a kinda bad feeling......."

"All of them said so at first. Well, I dare you to try and don’t think you have been fooled. Hey, father, gimme three cups."

He picked out three coppers from the pouch hung by the fist fighter’s belt and dropped them with a “**cha~linn**” sound a on dark long board. If the value of the coin is the same as that in Human World, the mysterious “Obsidia boil” will be worth of ten shears, which was way too cheap as for a light street food.

The shopkeeper without any reply arranged three wooden bowls on the long board, poured with the sound of “**dobobo**” the contents of the pan with a long ladle, and accompanied the spoon of the same wood. Again, without saying a word, he collected coins and returning to his stirring work.

Whether was accustomed to that or simply being drunk, but fist fighter took bowls one by one in both hands without any concern of the shop owner's correspondence which was extremely frustrating, and presented them to Kirito and Ronye. There was no option to refuse left any more once this is done, so they accepted it saying "Thank you very much" at the same time.

There was something inside the bowl that could only be described as a thick brown soup. It seemed that various items were contained in it, but since the liquid was almost opaque, what was being boiled could not be determined by looking down.

Ronnie sat down with Kirito at a vacant table, urged by a fist fighter with his bowl, and prepared her spirits.

She scooped up some liquid concentrated like stew cooked for three consecutive days, blew it and put in the mouth. _Spicy!_ she thought at first, but at once felt sourness, and after that the taste brought complicated richness with a shade of bitterness, and ended with a faint sweet aftertaste.

"............ Kirito-senpai, what a strange taste is this.......?"

When Ronye asked with a loud voice, Kirito who ate a bite as well, was muttering staring at the wooden spoon with a complex expression.

"There is no doubt ...... It is the taste of "boil", both marvelous and disgusting, or rather it seems like a horribly subtle......."

"Oh...... Had senpai eaten this before, then?"

Finally noticing that Ronye turned to him, Kirito shook his head.

"Oh no, not quite....... There is a shop that serves similar dishes in the city I used to live. The shop owner resembles him either, but still it is...... The "boil" I know is something I was hardly able to eat because one had to fight though it’s spicy and sour and bitter and sweet tastes. But this Obsidia boil is orders or rather wraps tastes, making it indescribably mellow and......"

"Oh, so I see you tasted it, bro!"

A fighter who reduced the contents of the bowl to as much as 30% already he hit the Kirito’s back vigorously. 

"They say, from since the Imperial City of Obsidia was built, this Koitsu guy continues to add ingredients and simmer the soup for more than two hundred years every day. I guess this is not a Human World cuisine, **ga-ha-ha**!"

"Tha… that's right......."

Next to Kirito nodding with delicate face, Ronye unexpectedly shouted in surprise.

"Two… two hundred years......!? How, how does cooking's life last for so long? Soup and stew will be damaged usually after 5 days even in the midwinter..."

"That is where that fella’s spiffy."

And as if he was some kind of relative of the shopkeeper, the fist fighter proudly hit his thick chest.

"This fella is not going a step away from the counter every day, he keeps on adjusting the fire so the pot does not become empty or burnt. If you do keep doing it constantly, it seems that the content of the pot will not lose life. Naturally I eat here three meals a day......I am thinking that this is only this fella not only in Dark Territory, but in entire Underworld, that can cook such a thing. "

"Well, every day, that is......."

She stared on the counter in question. An unfriendly shopkeeper kept stirring the pot with his face down, and his face could not be seen again.

"....... So, has his life been frozen if he is alive for more than two hundred years...? "

To Ronye's question, the fist fighter, who apparently came up with such a possibility for the first time, looked at the bowl and counter a number of times with a serious look and then shook his head from side to side.

"No way, I heard rumors that it is the highest priest of Human World only who can do it. I guess here it has surely been generation to generation inherited."

"Well, that's probably right."

Ronye nodded and scooped up some larger lump settled in the middle of the bowl and fearfully put it in her mouth. _It is probably a meat of a bird that gives this extremely light crunchy feeling when it collapses with every bite overflowing with rich flavor. Also, complicated strange flavor, if you get used to it — there is nothing you’ll like more._

Kirito who emptied the bowl with considerable momentum probably got used to it faster than Ronye, exhaled contentedly.

"Haha, it was horrible...... it may not be an overstatement......."

He stretched his spine and lowered his head deeply to a fist fighter sitting opposite.

"Thank you for the meal, a kind man. I will never forget this kindness."

"Nothing, that’s for good."

The fist fighter who had finished eating a long ago nodded with his smiling face.

"When you find a nice job here and a day comes when you can eat Obsidia boil as much as you want, please give one to me... as they say..."

Rubbing the face gently with a thick palm, he kept on smiling.

"...... It might be a bit difficult for you to find work for both brother and sister in Obsidia now, bro."

"Oh ... is that so? It is lively in the streets even at such time and it seems to be nice... "

"It looks like it looks, but that's because the number of residents is increasing ... and I do not think it will last for long..."

The fighter who told them so with a sigh bought a dubious vial from the goblin that passed nearby. He squeezed it and gulped, then held it out, frowning.

Although Kirito seemed to be dealing fine with it for a moment, he immediately coughed violently as soon as exhaled. The fist fighter to whom the bottle has been returned, smiled and continued the explanation.

"This hooch is made by the flat goblin tribe that settled near the city recently. It is tasty, and because it is cheap like nothing at all, it sells great. The town liquor store is shabby and sales are falling, and the commercial guilds seem to be crisp. If it is before the war, the guard soldiers would attack the goblin village and kill them all, but now there is a Peace Treaty of the Five Peoples......."

"...... That is, as long as sub-humans move to Obsidia, humans will be robbed of work...?"

"It's not just fault of sub-humans, the number of people is increasing considerably......That's what bro should see."

In response to Kirito's question, the fighter shrugged his shoulders and answered, looking up at the dark sky.

"If you came from Faldera I don’t need to tell you...... the land is just killing everything in this dark world. Humans and subhumans have always been suffering from hunger and thirst. Even the big war that ended the "era of iron and blood" began with a fight for a lake of some tribe’s origin..."

Ronnie and Kirito, who were not familiar with the history of the Dark Territory, must only silently nod. Fist fighter drank another gulp and kept on talking diligently.

"......Our ancestors managed to survive in this Dark Territory because there was a legend we believed. Someday the Human World gate will open and we will move to a promised rich land."

As soon as she heard the words, Ronye unintentionally strengthened her body, but the fist fighter did not seem to notice.

"...Neither my small brother nor sister would not have survived till that age, but as Emperor Vector recovered a little over than a year ago, it was awesome excitement when I was attacking the Human world. Finally, the time of legend came, we thought... ── But, Human World Integrity Knights, rumors say, were worse than any monster...... Besides, then suddenly an army of a different world emerged. I did not understand anything, but the emperor was kidnapped by some swordsman of the Human World, and the war was over......"

Ronye looked at "some swordsman" next to her who had already cold sweat spreading over his forehead with a face more delicate than when he tasted Obsidia boil. A fist fighter who hopefully had no way of knowing the true identity of the young man sitting in front of him opened his mouth again slamming a spoon on the table.

"...If the war continued as rumors say, this time the God of the Dark Territory may have perished for good. So, there are no complaints about peace with Human World, but it is also true that there is no hope of getting rich land someday left.... That is why goblins, orks and human youth are flowing into Obsidia...... They think here is fine, they say, they will be able to find a better life. However, no matter how much those hunkys are impatient, there is no infinite work appearing. Perhaps if you are a human being, you might be hired by a knights’ order.... but both bro and sis are a bit too weak, so ..."

Looking at the fist fighter sleepy winking drunken eyes directed towards two people, Kirito who seemed to be thinking once again, dropped his head down.

"Thank you for everything, uncle. Obsidia boil, it was delicious ...... Someday, we’ll treat you."

"Oh...... Good luck, both of you……"

Finally, they got up carefully as not to wake up a fist fighter who had fallen asleep earnestly.

Overlooking the plaza, it seemed a group of goblins and orks had left unnoticed, and only a few drunk groups of fist fighters remained. Most of the counters are also starting to close, and only the shopkeeper who cooked Obsidia boil kept stirring the pot. It seemed like their chat of staying over there was becoming reality.

"... Well, aren’t we supposed to be looking for an inn?"

Kirito, who made a big yawn, murmured such a thing in a confused tone.

"But what do you do for paying rent? Indeed, I think those who will pay will not appear."

"Well, I’ll manage somehow."

Finally, Kirito laughed and started to walk to the east exit of the square; Ronnie inevitably chased him.

***

The number of ore lanterns increased and the bustle became louder as they got closer to the center of the city.

However, after listening to the story of a fighter, the colorful lights reflected the modest resistance to the killing ground, and the bustle felt filled with the complaints accumulated by people.

Kirito solved the penniless problem by unexpectedly modest means of getting a knife in his pocket to be bought by a roadside street vendor; from the shopkeeper he learnt a location of a cheap inn and began to walk again. Ronye talked in a bright voice to a Prime Swordsman who was somewhat less talkative than usual.

"This currency, "beck"<sup><a href="#Prim8">8</a></sup>. Is the value of one beck the same as one shear in Human World?"

"Ehm...? Oh, yes, I have such a feeling. The thing is that the cup of Obsidia boil is still quite cheap though... "

"Well, I guess you would want to eat it again, senpai?"

"As expected, a swordsman-dono cannot hide any secret from his former valet."

After putting a hand on the Ronye’s head with a glad face, Kirito pointed to the building on the right front side with that same hand.

"Apparently this is an inn recommended by that old weapons vendor."

It looked like the Human World inns, except from the dark stone walls, with a signboard of cast iron symbolizing sacred letters I, N, N protruding. When Ronye saw it, a strange doubtful feeling appeared in her heart, but it was swayed away like a ripple before she chose words to express it.

"...? ....What happened, Ronye?"

She shook her head quickly towards Kirito who tilts his head.

"No, it’s nothing."

"OK.... It was a hard day, let's get down early."

That said, Kirito grasped two large and one small pieces of luggage and walked over to the door under the sign.

Fortunately, despite the near midnight time, the inn was still open. The innkeeper was a woman of about forty years old who looked at Kirito and Ronye for a few seconds with a suspicious face, but did not seem to doubt the story of brother and sister who came to find a job from Faldera.

But it seems that Kirito could not anticipate that the fictional story would create new problems. After saying “One room is good if you are brother and sister!”, the woman did not want to listen anything more and guided, or rather pushed two people ─ moreover, requiring to pay double of 100-beck one-night accommodation price upon checkout ─ to a room on the second floor.

"Be sure to leave by the ten bells in the morning! The bath has already dropped the heat, so if you want to wash, you go to a bathhouse next to it. They will give a discount you if you say you’re a customer of my place!"

And, mumbling over words, which were unlikely kind or cheerful, hostess disappeared downstairs.

Ronye was stunned for a moment, and Kirito said in a somewhat awkward voice.

"Err.... I'm sorry, Ronye. Because I was particular about the cheap hotel, it's like this..."

"No, thanks to senpai..."

"I can sleep properly outside, so Ronye can use this room."

"Well, properly probably..."

"Either somewhere on the eaves or in the park, nothing will happen to me. Please take a good rest today. I will come back tomorrow morning."

Ronye hurriedly pulled the cloak of Kirito going out through the window.

"It’s, it's useless, senpai! It is so cold out there, you will catch a cold if you imitate fist fighters!"

She looked around the room. _In addition to a simple bed, one sofa for two people is placed. It seems that it may be a bit too short for legs, but can’t say I won’t be able to sleep_, thought Ronye.

"I will go to sleep at the sofa there, senpai please use bed."

"Well, no, but... Isn’t there anything in Taboo Index of Imperial Fundamental Law? Isn’t there a ban on unmarried men and women sleeping in the same room?

"There is no such thing. What is prohibited is kiss… kissing in the lips and also... as well as............"

"Well, what is it?"

Ronye firmly grasped shoulders of Kirito who moved his ear closer with a puzzled face, and pushed him with all her force in the direction of the bed.

"Whatever it may be, senpai is Human World Prime Swordsman, and I am Integrity Knight trainee, so it does not matter!"

"Wow~!"

Kirito’s legs slipped on the floor, he crumbled backside and set on the bed. Without even a shortest delay she untied strings of his cloak and pulled it away, removed boots from both feet, and pushed him down into a laid position allowing no further questions.

She then pulled up the cotton-top cover up to his neck, and when thumping in her chest started to cease, the Prime Swordsman said to her through wry smile and laughter.

"... Ronye, you are like my mother, in a way."

"Ah... I'm sorry, my mother always did this when I was a child."

"I see...... Would be great to see Ronnie's parents, someday..."

As Kirito said such words looking up at the ceiling, Ronnie remembered her last month homecoming. It obviously revived the memories of a number of proposals from her relatives, but somehow, she pushed them back.

".......Yes, I'm sure my parents will be happy."

_It would be my youngest brother that would be pleased the most_, but when she decided to voice this thought, Kirito lightly smiled and closed the eyelids. In just a few seconds, gentle snuffle could be heard. _He had much more calm face all the time, but I think that the tiredness from flying 3000 kilolu from Human World with a machine dragon still remained._

Relieved that Kirito quietly slept in the bed, Ronye took off her cloak and after a bit of struggle with an ore lantern ─ turned out she had to pour water into it ─ turned it off.

Sitting on the sofa that was standing by the wall, she carefully removed her shoes and put them on the floor, and lied down. Although her toes protruded as expected, she didn’t mind the cold covering with a coat made of a cotton cloth and a good western region wool instead of a blanket.

![Image](/Translate/Img/p175.jpg)

Ronye immediately felt drowsy, but against it she stared at the profile of Kirito lit by city light coming through the window.

_What really happens if my senpai really comes to my house......_ she though and let her imagination to play for a while.

_It would not be that Kirito's family is only his sister known as "green swordsman Leafa". In the real world she returned to, there should be parents, possibly other brothers and sisters, and friends. But until now, Kirito never spoke of his family.  
Does he want to go home…… I wonder is he thinks of this._

There was no reason not to. Even Ronye, who had a family house in the same city of Centoria, sometimes wanted to see her parents and brother.

But Ronye could not have the courage to ask Kirito about it. _If I wait for too long and say that...... do you want to go back home someday? — I do not know whether what the answer would be any good. Initially, I do not even know whether there is a way to return to the real world.  
I wonder what kind of place it is._

The Underworld people who fought in the Foreign World War almost without exceptions felt fear and disgust rather than familiarity to the real world which is only known by name. Ronye was no exception. Just thinking that horrible red knights that caused many lives to be lost to both the Human World Defense Army and the Dark Territory Army made her feel terrible and limbs became cold.

_On the other hand, real world is home to Kirito, Asuna, and swordsmen who came to the rescue to the Human World Army during the Foreign World War.  
Even in Underworld there are good people and bad people. The real world may be the same. However, I do not think I want the way in to open again.  
Integrity Knight Alice traveled to the other world, what did she saw there, I wonder? Could it be that the day will come when I can meet her again and hear her story.......?_

When she thought that far, the same strange feeling as when she saw the sign of the inn once again shook her heart, but finally she could not bear the weight of the eyelids, so Ronye went down to sleep in the foreign land far away.
