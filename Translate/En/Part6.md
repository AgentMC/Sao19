# Part 6

Dawn of the next day, 19th February.

In the huge dragon stables by the western end of Cathedral site, Ronye was stroking the neck of her beloved Tsukigaki again and again.

Young Tsukigaki was making sound of “**Kurururu**”... narrowing the eyes, half from the pleasure, half because it was simply still sleepy. Not only the young dragon, but also Tiese leaning against the silvery fence was sweepingly rocking the red hair. Last night, Ronye thought about going to bed early but could not fall asleep, so she talked to Tiese about a lot of things in the living room.

It is strange that topics for long talks wouldn’t run out even though they were together every day for nearly two years, but her best friend was that kind of person. Kirito and Yujio also had to leave northern Rulid village, traveled to the central capital, entered the Sword Mastery Academy, took years to become Elite Swordsmen, but it was always fun to talk to those two people: about swordsmanship, and fights, and sometimes even sharing the silence was perfectly cozy.

_Now Tiese is at the crossroad of adult life. Whether she accepts the proposal of Integrity Knight Renri, or refuses, I think we can at least remain best friend forever._

"... Well then, Tsukigaki, I’ll go, I guess. Listen carefully to Tiese and be a good boy."

Ronye stood up, and the young dragon lifted his neck and replied "**Kyuru~**".

***

When they finally moved to the arsenal behind Cathedral together with Tiese who finally looked awoken, the Machine Dragon Version 2 was already drawn out to the cobblestone yard.

It was not standing vertically like Version 1, but laid on the ground with three legs, just as it was inside the arsenal. Looking closely, one could see that tips of legs weren’t claws like that of a real dragon but had wheels attached.

Kirito, Asuna, Fanatio, chief of engineering master Sadore were standing close to its head, and there was one more person, a woman of the same age Ronye wearing the arsenal work clothes was standing by the side of a dragon, casting some sacred art with her hand touching the fuselage.

Ronye recognized aerial element generation expression and turned to her friend who stood next holding a bag.

"Hey Tiese, is that girl......."

"Oh, yes, that's her. This young woman was the elevator operator before it has been automated."

"Oh...... she’s cute, is she not?"

"She is, but there is a rumor that this cute girl lives as long as Dusolbert, at least."

"That… that's also true..."

Kirito noticed two people stopped a little away and having a conversation and waved his hand.

"Hey Ronye, Tiese, over here."

"Ah... yes, good morning!"

"Morning!"

They said greetings walking up to him.

Although the sky was still dark, the Machine Dragon Ver. 2 seen outdoors was bigger than she imagined. In addition to having two cockpit seats, left and right wings were elongated to the size of real dragon’s ones, and nozzles in the back were larger as well. The total length would be 40% more than that of Ver. 1, reaching about seven mel.

_Will I ride this? I guess feeling nervous is expected though, but there is no time to show fear as I volunteered myself._

And trying to push the suddenly resurrected in vivid colors image of the last moments of Version 1 out of her mind, she lowered her head again in front of Kirito and Asuna.

"Sorry, we’re late."

"No, it’s still well before the five o'clock."

Kirito answered in a relaxed tone even though it was a while after the bell had rang 4:30 pm, then he got a glance at the new sword on the Ronye’s left waist and smiled.

"Ronye, my escort guard, I kindly ask you to take care of me."

"Ye...... Yes!"

_Even at the cost of my life...._ After she began to reply...... she remembered the words between her and Asuna last night. As a result, she got it out of her mouth.

"I, I will do my best!"

Although it was a childish word, both Kirito and Asuna nodded again with smiles.

They greeted Fanatio and Sadore as well, then she took package from Tiese. Because it was packed up tightly with supplies and clothes a medium-sized bag was pretty heavy, _but should be fine since it’s going to be put into the machine dragon......_ she was thinking.

"Kirito-san, the aerial element charge has been completed"

Having heard such a voice from behind, Ronye and Tiese turned around at the same time. The owner of the voice was a girl who had been previously called an elevator operator; one could say that instead of work clothes of the arsenal or clerics’ robes, an aristocratic dress would more likely to fit her fragile beautiful face.

"Thank you Airy, you saved me."

A girl called Airy to whom Kirito addressed these words bowed without changing a face expression and went by Sadore.

Immediately afterwards, Cathedral's bell gently played the 5 o'clock melody, Kirito clapped hands energetically.

"Well, then, let us be off! Ronye, hand your luggage over here."

She handed the bag that would be her luggage to the stretched-out hand, and Kirito opened a small door on the side of the machine dragon and placed it inside. After seeing it, Ronye firmly hugged Tiese. There was no need to say anything, Ronye's "Well, see you soon" and Tiese’s "Come back safely" thoughts instantly came across between the two of them.

As she released the hug, looked at her best friend's face and nodded, Kirito had already moved to the head of the machine dragon. He urged to get up the ladder extending from the ground to the head, and she obeyed; up there she found a small oval room with two chairs: one in front and one in the back.

Because the backrest of the front chair was collapsed, Ronye removed the sword from the waist and squeezed the body behind the chair. Chairs were simple, just leather stretched over the metal frame, but made of highly valuable red horn cow leather rich in flexibility and comfort, so it was overall not as bad as expected.

Kirito immediately came up the ladder after her, returned the back of the front chair to its original angle and sat there. Sadore removed the ladder, then Kirito pulled the handle, the glass canopy came down and closed.

Same moment Ronye’s heart began to pound and she gulped the saliva.

Tsukigaki was still young and couldn’t fly, but there have been many times she was allowed to ride Renri’s  Kazenui<sup><a href="#Prim1">1</a></sup>, Fizel's Himawari and Linel's Hinageshi<sup><a href="#Prim2">2</a></sup>. As expected it was scary for the first one or two times, but the pleasant feeling of flying through the air soon grew above fear. However, she never thought of flying in the sky by herself, or specifically with the artificial dragon made of metal, moreover, flying inside of it rather than riding on the back, so a feeling of incongruity completely engulfed her. _In the first place, there are no wings for flapping, so how would it return to the ground anyway after taking off?_

That moment she again remembered the scene where Version 1 exploded and after calming down her trembling body she asked.

"Ah ... that, Kirito-senpai."

"What's it?"

Ronye bent ahead and asked the Prime Swordsman who returned relaxed voice from the front seat.

"Like the previous dragon, this one releases its thermal energy to fly, right?"

"That's right."

"In the early morning, if you fly in the sky with a loud sound like the one before, won’t people in the capital be surprised and scared...?"

"I guess it could be the case......."

After nodding, Kirito continued in a little difficult to understand words.

"But since the length of the runway is not enough here in the first place, we cannot take off horizontally. Which means, for Version 2 taking off and landing, unfortunately, we’ll have to cheat a bit."

"Chee… cheat...... a... bit...?"

Kirito did not reply to that question but only laughed, and then firmly grasped two metal rods placed in the front of the chair. His hands began to suddenly emit light, and Ronye breathed in.

It was not the light of a sacred art. Kirito's will, directly connected to the matter of the world itself, was visible as light. In other words, it was the radiance of incarnation<sup><a href="#Prim3">3</a></sup>.

The steel dragon shivered like a living thing. Immediately afterwards, the feeling of the body getting lifted away arrived.

Ronye hurriedly looked out through the glass lid. The gray cobblestones and figures Tiese, Asuna and others were slowly moving away. Kirito was lifting the huge machine dragon entirely with the incarnation power.

Watching the ground Ronye was thinking that this was certainly a cheating. As the rising speed increased, the size of those seen outside decreased accordingly. Eventually the white morning haze concealed them, the rose garden spreading north of the arsenal and the white wall of Cathedral occupied the sight.

She put both hands together and looked straight ahead; the dark-blue before dawn sky had spread far and wide. Ronnie lost her words to the beauty of the horizon that was starting to slowly illuminated with red.

When the dragon had risen as high as the large public bath on Cathedral’s ninetieth floor, it stopped the elevation and began to move horizontally. It was quite different from the powerful flapping of the real dragons, more like gliding on the water surface. Nothing else could be heard than a low humming wind noise. This way the citizens of Centoria would not notice them unless they were looking up at the sky at dawn.

But as soon as one concern cleared up, another one came to her head.

"...... Kirito-senpai, will you be fine as you move such a big thing with the power of incarnation?"

After asking the one in the front seat, she panicked if she had disturbed the Kirito’s concentration, but soon the answer was returned with an unchanged tone.

"Well, for a while I will. But it is hard to fly this way as you leave Human World."

"Oh, I see......"

Again, she was amazed by the unrelenting willpower of the Human World Prime Swordsman.

Ronye also practiced as a knight trainee, but not only practical results of "Standing straight on the top of a pillar" which required standing on a thin pillar with one foot, "Controlling the created element" teaching of handling the element created in the air with pure will, but even "Tanza mind emptying" which is basically just sitting on the floor and trying to get rid of all the thoughts — could hardly proceed to the next stage.

Even for the senior knights like Fanatio or Dusolbert, trainings only included secret incarnational techniques like "Arm of Mind" allowing to move things of the size of about a dagger with one’s will and "Blade of Mind" which swings invisible blade, so Kirito's incarnation allowing humans to freely flight a huge machine dragon that carries a human rider was way beyond of normality.

"...... Even with such a strong senpai’s mind power, the "end wall of the world" can still not be crossed...."

When Ronye muttered that, Kirito nodded with a bitter smile.
