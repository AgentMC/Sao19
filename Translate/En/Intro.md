# Intro

The footstep sounds of two are echoing in a corridor formed with stretching up white columns. 

Running ahead is a girl wearing gray light armor and slender long sword with fluttering dark brown hair. Just behind her, a young dragon covered in pale yellow wool with whole body being fluffy chases while shaking a long tail. The head of the dragon, which has not yet developed corners, is slightly higher than the girl's waist.

The girl's name is Ronye Arabel. The name of the young dragon is Tsukigaki<sup><a href="#Prim1">1</a></sup>.

From a beautiful, causing to smile sight as if in a fairy tale, it is hard to imagine that in a few years the girl and the young dragon will grow up to "Integrity Knights" with the greatest fighting power in the Underworld.

But indeed, even now, there won’t be even 100 people in the whole world, who surpass Ronye in sword skill. The girl was always fighting at the forefront of that terrible "foreign world war"<sup><a href="#Prim2">2</a></sup>, followed by the "Rebellion of Four Empires", and for the first time in history, it was appointed to be an Integrity Knight apprentice by the battle in actual war.

However ───.

The girl’s polished sword skill that will bloom to perfection soon, will probably have no opportunity to be required on the battlefield.

Because Underworld finally got complete peace at the end of the 300-year-old dispute.

Six peoples: Human World, Dark Territory, Goblins, Orcs, Ogres and Giants tied permanent peace treaty. The privileges of the four emperors and the aristocracy of the human world who were oppressing the other people were also eliminated. Merchants' wagons go one after another through the collapsed Great Eastern Gate, and you can see visitors from the Dark Territory in the central city of Centoria. Fear and hostility that used to separate two worlds, are melting without a trace like the snow in the sun.

The girl with the sword swinging at the waist and the young dragon run in a gentle sunlight creating a diagonal striped pattern shielded by columns.

The moving away sound of two’s footsteps and patter was becoming barely heard, and eventually disappear.

A big butterfly appeared from anywhere dancing in the corridor to enjoy the quiet that returned again.
