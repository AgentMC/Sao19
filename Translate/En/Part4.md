# Part 4

Next day, February 18th.

Ronye sitting at lunch understood that an incident just happened that shook even that single wish of her.

The low-ranking knight jumped in with wry face, kneeled by Kirito and cried out that ──

Mountain Goblin tourists murdered one Centoria citizen in Centoria’s Central Park.

***

State Prime Swordsman, and even Vice-Prime Swordsman who perhaps was bolder than the one, both opened their eyes wide and inhaled rapidly.

Kirito pondered briefly, then quickly put a knife and a fork and stood up.

"Asuna and Fanatio, please ask commanders of the Human World Defense Army and the squadron leads. Do regular missions only, do not attempt to any special measures regarding this case. ── Where are those of Goblin tribe now?"

The second half of a question was addressed to the low-ranking knight who brought the message. The kneeling knight still retaining the appearance of the boy, replied.

"Yeah, I heard that he is already imprisoned in the South Centoria guard office!"

"I understood, messenger, thanks for the effort!"

As soon as he said that, Kirito threw over his black suit and started walking away in long steps.

Ronye at last recovered from astonishment, stood up in a hurry and shouted from the other side of the big round table.

"I... I ask for permission to accompany you, Prime-dono!"

Kirito thought of that for a moment, and soon he nodded.

"I beg your pardon. Is it OK to have a little shortcut?"

"Well...... yes. Ehm......."

Ronye’s eyebrows jumped up as she ran after him. _There’s nothing to shortcut, Central Cathedral is located in the center of the circular central capital, it’s enough to run down the Cathedral stairway and leave the South Gate, that is already the city of South Centoria, the capital of the former Southacroith Empire. Important facilities such as the guard office should be along the main street that extends from the Cathedral and penetrates through the city, in other words, straight to the destination._

To Ronye’s unspoken question, Kirito replied with action. Without a doubt, he went to the balcony on the east side of the hall, not to the big door on the south side.

Ronye who followed him saw the view from the height of about 20 floors of Cathedral and thought: _no way!_

But Kirito saying “excuse me” had already wrapped his left arm around Ronye's body. There was no time for the heart to bounce.

**Biyu~n!** Strange sound echoed and her field of vision was covered by green light.

Immediately after, even before Ronye feeling that her body is lifted casually into the air had a chance to raise the voice, two people rushed out into the sky with fierce momentum.

Cathedral was immediately left behind. The vast city of the central capital spread in front of their eyes. It was not like being just fast. Although it seemed that their speed is likely to reach several times the maximum speed dragons can fly, wind pressure was hardly felt. _Air resistance is eliminated by wrapping our bodies with membrane constructed from aerial element, and it seems we are getting huge thrust by continuously bursting more aerial elements from behind.  
This is "aerial elements flight technique" which can be used only by Kirito in the entire Underworld_ ─ and when she realized that, two of them descended to the ground like a gale.

A mysterious sound echoed again, and the color of the vision restored. She blinked several times to shake away the attacking dizziness, just in front of the huge ─ although it couldn’t be compared to Cathedral, of course, ─ stone building. The rough texture wall cut out of the red sandstone is undoubtedly unique to South Centoria.

The front entrance at the top of the stone steps was guarded by two people dressed in thick armor. Kirito walked straight towards them raising large halberds without trying to hide caution scared with the sudden appearance of Ronye.

"Name yourselves!<sup><a href="#Prim1">1</a></sup>"

Despite inquired for identity, guards crossed their spears with clash, so Ronye cried out as quick as possible from behind Kirito.

"We’re from the Human World Union Council!"

The Integrity Knights coat of arms embroidered on the short cloak caught the gaze of the guards. Because she still was a trainee, there was no number that should normally be stamped at the bottom, but fortunately it still seemed to have demonstrated sufficient effectiveness. Guards swiftly took an upright posture and with high sound struck the stone ground with a halberds’ poles.

Kirito ran at once between two people. Ronye followed.

Ronye only now had noticed that the Prime Swordsman of the Human World Union Council had not even wearing cloak or mantle bearing a coat of arms. It was just a simple black hemp shirt and also black thick cotton trousers. Therefore, one couldn’t really blame the guards who did not recognize him.

The officials of the guard office were glancing surprisingly at his bad look, but Kirito headed straight to the stairs to the basement. As if he already knew where the problem goblin is held.

No, it seemed that was the case. When they ran down the stone steps halfway, a distinctive shriek squeaky voice arrived in Ronye's ears.

".......nything! Me not do anything! Not see anything!"

"Stop telling lies, you subhuman scum<sup><a href="#Prim2">2</a></sup>!"

A dull sound followed the rude voice.

The second basement floor of the guard office was a prison separated by a black grid. Saying of which, guardians who passed here before left footsteps in the faint dust covering the floor, so looked like it had not been used for many years. Naturally, criminals did not appear in the Human World in principle, and it was only in very rare cases when someone could not remember the vast provisions of Taboo Index and the Empire Basic Law end-to-end so "as a result had committed a petty offense" and was released. ── So far.

At the end of the passage there was a spacious room without iron bars, probably a place for interrogation. Clunky wooden desk was standing in the center of the dimly lit room, and who was lying face down there was definitely a still young mountain goblin. 

A tough guard was pressing down that small body from behind. And in the front, a man standing in the uniform of the captain swinging his long swords at a high rate.

"Let’s see if it continues that dirty lies even after one arm is cut away!"

The sword moved down barely reflecting the light of the candle.

_── Stop it!_

Ronnie tried to shout, but sooner than that ──

**Kin!** A sharp sound echoed, and sparks were scattered from the commander's sword as if it was struck by an invisible blade, it slipped out of his hand and stuck in the wall behind.

Kirito delivered a "sword of mind", a secret weapon of integrity knights. A young man wearing a black suit who fought off the captain’s sword ran with the full speed and cried jumping into the interrogation room without stopping.

"That’s all! Everything about this matter will as of now be taken over by the Human World Union Council!"

"Name yo......."

The captain who was gazing at the blown away sword, looked back and stared at Kirito with red face. His carefully trimmed mustache trembled and he was just about crying something loudly but his eyes captured the shoulder of Ronye.

The expression changed drastically again, and at the same time the color of the blood completely gone from their faces. The captain and his man quickly kneeled and drooped heads against Ronye rather than Kirito.

The opportunities of such worship from the people of Centoria have actually increased considerably. But she did not feel like getting used to it. Anyway, Ronye was only a student until one year and three months ago. She applied to the Human World Defense Army as a result of a Foreign World War, fought it feverishly with her sword and immediately became appointed as a knight trainee, so she could not learn something like resolution or dignity at all.

_Even if he is dressed properly, I couldn’t avoid this unbearable wish to disappear_, thought Ronye watching over Kirito’s actions.

A young man who could be easily seen as one of the citizens living in the central capital, first of all, nodded to calm down the mountain goblin youth who was quietly shaking the whole body and asked with a gentle voice.

"You, your name?"

The goblin blinked yellowish eyes violently, but soon responded feebly.

"............Oroy"

"Oroy? That decorative feathers, are they from the clan of Uboli of the hill?"

Goblin nodded carefully touching blue and yellow feathers extending from the leather wrapped around the forehead.

"Ok, my name is Kirito and I am the Prime of the Human World Union Council."

As soon as the two head-down kneeling guards backed step after step, the youngster named Oroy widely opened the eyes and shouted.

"Kirito....knows, me knows! White um which played irritating insects collection contest with Uboli and won!"

── Ronye was amazed to the deep of her heart with what he was doing, but of course she did not let it to reflect on her face. Kirito said to that nodding gracefully.

"I still keep properly the medal of Centurion I got at that time. Well, Oroy, from now on, I’ll listen to your stories in order, first from these guards, then from you. Since I will not punish by just their content, please calm down and tell me only the things that have happened."

***

The guard captain who stood up as requested by Kirito said with a face reflecting both anger and awe, as follows.

── Today at around 11:30 am, a report from the citizen came to the guards central office of South Centoria on 4th Avenue, "The fellow is ramping with knives in Karoo street inn". We advanced immediately, and on the second floor in the corridor of the inn, the goblin stood with blooded dagger and a man in the back room was bleeding. The man was a cleaner at the inn, his heart was stabbed, and by that moment his life completely depleted. Judging from the situation we decided that the goblin killed a man with the dagger, instantly took him over to the office and started interrogating ──.

In contrast, the mountain goblin Oroy explained as follows.

── Oroy, with five young people of the same family, came to Centoria on sightseeing trip three days ago. Fellows went to the town after breakfast, but Oroy was sick and was sleeping in the inn's room. Someone knocked the door late morning, when he got out, there were no shadows, but a dagger was falling in the hallway. He picked it up and realized that blood was on it, he was looking at it for some time, then a guard came up from the stairs and he was caught before he knew what was going on.

***

"...... Me, do not do anything ....... Wonder what happened, just  look..."

As soon as Oroy concluded that story, the captain shouted impatiently.

"Well, I guess you had to say so! That dagger is not from the human world! The only ones who use such a bad casting are sub-humans!"

"Diff, different! That sword, it looks alike but is different! Goblin sword, it contains the emblem of the clan in the pommel! That sword does not, it is a fake!"

When Oroy refuted screechingly, the captain tried to respond again. Kirito stopped him with his right hand raised and said.

"It will be known if we investigate. Captain, where’s the dagger now?"

"...... is kept in the weapon store on the first floor."

"Sorry, will not you show it to me?"

Then the captain looked to his subordinate. A young guard officer rushed out as if he had been chased but kept them waiting for nearly five minutes before reporting back with pale face and no dagger.

"…………There is none"

"What, what you say! "

The captain, who yelled loudly, shrunk his neck to the limit and the guard repeated.

"So, the dagger in question cannot be found in the armor store anymore."

## Footnotes:

1. <a name="Prim1"></a>“Hold right there” would be more appropriate localized version, but that’s how original reads, plus this is the reason for Ronye’s next phrase.
2. <a name="Prim2"></a>The goblin says “me” as オイラ (“oira”), which can be a version of properly-written “oira” - おいら - so it should be probably male. However, in this line, the guard uses め (“me”) which can be a female pronoun or maybe a shortening of てめえ (“temee”). In other words, I’m totally confused with the gender of the goblin. I’ll treat it as a male for now.
