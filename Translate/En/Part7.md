# Part 7

<!--<sup><a href="#Prim1">1</a></sup>-->

When she awoke to the heavy sound of a bell, the bright light was already falling through the thin window curtain.

After blinking several times, she scratched the eyes and set in the sofa. With the cloak wrapped instead of a blanket around the body, she looked around the room with drowsy eyes.

First thing she saw was the figure of a black-haired swordsman sleeping deeply in the bed in front of the sofa. Eight hours passed, and the effect of the ointment had gone out, so the sleeping face that regained whiteness was surprisingly inconvenient, and Ronye smiled a little.

Finally, she realized that she had stayed overnight in the same room with Kirito ─ even though, of course, the beds were separate ─ and all the drowsiness immediately faded away, the face got hot. She put her cold hands, which were out of the cloak, on her head and took a deep breath to somehow regain calmness, then got up vigorously.

Moved to the side of the bed, gently shook the shoulders of sleeping Kirito.

"Senpai, please get up, it's eight o'clock."

When Ronye heard it last night, she noticed that the melody of the bell was exactly the same as that of Central Cathedral’s ones.

_Why do the bells installed in the Human World Axiom Church and the bells of the Dark Territory capital far away from each other playing the same sound..?_ At the time of such thoughts, Kirito revealed ambiguous mumbling and tried to get in under the blanket.

"Ugh...... a bit more ............"

"Ah, sleeping is waste!"

In a hurry she tried to pull off the blanket, but Kirito did not let it go, firmly holding the edge with both hands like a child.

"Five minutes more...... No, let me sleep for just three minutes, Yujio..."

When she heard that name, Ronye inhaled a small breath. Pulling a hand away from the blanket, she walked one step away.

About two years have elapsed since Elite Swordsman-in-Training Yujio, who was a close friend of Kirito, lost his life in battle with the Highest Priest Administrator. For Kirito, however, the days spent with Yujio have not been left in the past. Just like for Tiese.

On her tiptoes, she returned to the sofa and sat again.

_Asuna, a Vice-Prime Swordsman who is waking up in the same room as Kirito, knows Kirito's heart... Does she know the existence of deep sorrow that he is hiding? And if she does, I wonder how does she keeps her gentle, kind smile standing by Kirito......._

She decided to talk to Asuna properly upon the return to Centoria. Of course, not about the feeling kept secretly in Ronye’s mind, but because both of them feel they want to be the power of Kirito.

While she was thinking about such things, surprisingly Kirito woke up in about three minutes as declared asleep, and looked the room around with both eyes closed more than half.

When noticing Ronye, he had a great yawn “**Fuwa\~~**” and called out "Good morning Ronye".

"...... Yes, good morning, Kirito-senpai."

"Bad, I overslept... What time is it now?"

"The eight o'clock bell has just rung."

"Oh, so for checkou... ehm, it looks like we will be on time to leave the inn."

Once again, he gave a short yawn and then got up from the bed. Moved to the window and drew a gray curtain vigorously.

"Oh, Ronye, come here, you can see the castle."

"Really?"

As she moved away from the sofa and stood by the side of Kirito, to the slightly right side of the front of the window and beyond the cluttered cityscape, she could clearly see the big black castle towering up against the sky.

Its appearance piercing the morning glow of the Dark Territory, which was much redder than one of the Human World, although it is built from mostly natural rocks, was far more violent than Central Cathedral, which in reverse created a kind of beauty. Kirito, who should have been visiting for the second time, also exhaled a long breath as if admiring.

"... Unlike Central Cathedral built by Higher Priest Administrator’s sacred art, that castle was carved out of a rocky mountain with human hands."

Having heard the words of Kirito, Ronnie also sighed unwillingly.

"How many months... years did it take?"

"It took more than a hundred years. ── Now, let's leave soon. We don’t have time to rest till lunch."

"Hey, the one who overslept was senpai!"

Kirito began collecting his luggage when he replied to Ronye's point with a mischievous smile.

***

After painting the faces with brown ointment again and paying the rent the left, and morning sun dyed red greeted them with a light similar to that of ore lanterns.

There was a distance of more than 5 kilometers from the inn to Obsidia castle, they walked enjoying the scenery of a foreign country feeling great impatience.

As they got closer to the castle the road became wider and the buildings on both sides also became fine. However, the number of passers-by decreased rapidly, in particular the sub-humans are completely absent.

Eventually, a river rich in water, black as everything else in this dark world, and a fine stone bridge appeared. After it, there was a big gate, and the way ran gradually uphill, to a sharp obsidian mountain ─ to the imperial castle of Obsidia.

Ronye asked Kirito who stopped at the beginning of the bridge.

"...... So, senpai, have you come up with an idea on how to enter the castle?"

Then Prime Swordsman tilted his painted dark head lightly.

"Hmmm...... Even if we pretend to be Dark Territory dwellers, that alone will not open the way into the castle... or if we fly to the top of the castle, it seems, guards will find us..."

"In other words, you have no idea ...."

Kirito rushed to deny Ronye's words.

"No, no. I still have a last resort! "

Shouting so, he pulled Ronye's hand, and they went along the left bank of the river. _As the bridge that leads directly to the castle keeps getting away more and more, he surely wants to swim across this river which seems to be not easy at all, climb up the hill full of rocks and intrude into the castle._

Kirito stopped at a place where the river got a little wider, put two bags on the ground and looked up again at Obsidia castle.

Obsidian-black rocky mountain looked like a tower rather than a mountain because its base was about 300 mel in diameter, while its height was more than three times that. Most of the side facing the town was presented as a castle, with magnificent columns and large windows glittering in the morning sun, but the back side was almost a rocky mountain, only a large terrace was hanging high above which was probably the dragon departure ground.

Unexpectedly Kirito lifted his right hand and drew it straight towards the top of the castle. Moved five stretched fingers as if looking for something small.

"That, senpai...... what on earth...?"

A feeling of disturbing little by little came up, and Ronye said so. However, Kirito did not answer, after continuing to hold his right hand for about five seconds, he nodded as if he suddenly got something.

He aligned the fingers of the right hand as if his hand was holding a sword. Held it up, stretched the left leg and lowered his waist.

Ronye opened her eyes wide watching as in his right hand appeared something like a sword, wrapped in weak white light and emitting a faint vibration sound.

_Kirito did not cast any sacred art. So, this is a secret mystery of Integrity Knights who directly interact with "the matter of the world", a technique of incarnation. But, usually invisible, it shines with light and emits sound, how much will is concentrated here?_

"**............\~~Fu**!!"

With a short shout, Kirito swept his right hand with tremendous momentum.

A white light flickered as if it was one of knight Renri's “Twin Edged Wings” and instantly flew a distance of over 1 kilometer, hitting the handrail of a small terrace near the top of Obsidia castle. Ronye's trained eyes clearly recognized that a small obsidian fragment spilled from the handrail struck by the blade.

"What a......., se-se-se-se-se-senpai, what are you doing?! You scratched the castle!"

Although being astonished and surprised to a great extent by the blade of incarnation, she pulled a black cloak a bit more turning to Kirito who straightened body and answered with his usual relaxed tone.

"Don’t worry of that damage, it will disappear if they smear a piece of a charcoal with glue and stick there…I think. Now, look there."

As Kirito lifted his right hand again, she looked up to where he pointed. Then, she saw a small figure emerging from the terrace struck by Kirito's "blade of mind". As expected the distance was too far to see the face, but a slender body belonged to a human. Noticing the scratch of the handrail, the person looked below bending the upper body over the terrace’s border.

Even though it was more than one kilometer away, there is no place to hide in the open riverside where Kirito and Ronye were standing. The shadow of the terrace kept her eyes on the two of them... and that moment.

The figure suddenly put a right hand to its mouth.

Ronye noticed that a gray dragon appeared on a large landing block protruding from the back of the castle, spread its wings and took off.

The dragon flew around the side of the castle and stopped near the mentioned terrace. A shadow quickly jumped on its back and pointed straight to the riverside where Ronye was standing.

"…ba-ba-ba-ba-bad, senpai! They have found us already!"

"That was fast, as expected."

"You can’t say such things carelessly! We have to get away quick......!"

But Kirito pulled Ronye’s cloak, and stood in front of her. As he did this, the dragon suddenly descended next to two people.

_If that is the case, I have to fulfill the role of escort!_ And Ronye grasped the handle of the long sword just granted, but three seconds later...

A swooping down gray dragon beat wings violently and suddenly braked, and the rider flew from the back like a hurricane. The vision of the slender figure landing on a stony riverbank making no sound at all was quite spectacular. Like Ronye, the person wore a cloak with hood so the face could not be seen.

It seemed that the sword was not pulled out, but it should be a senior dark knight in order to be able to control the dragon. Standing in front of Kirito, Ronye felt the tension ready to pull out her sword as soon as the opponent’s sword appears.

── However.

A little later than a rider, a gray dragon landed with a big earthy sound, it stretched the long neck, first smelled Ronye, then Kirito. Afterwards..., with the sound of “**furururu**” it rubbed the side of a horned stout against Kirito’s head.

"Er…………?"

Ronye looked at the impossible scene. _The dragons of the Dark Territory are also very proud, like Human World dragons, I heard that they are from a related genus. It is impossible that it treats a first-time seen human like this..._ At that time, on the body of the dragon covered in gray scales, she noticed countless spear marks are left.

"Ah ... may… maybe......."

Faster than Ronye put the words together, Kirito spoke himself rubbing under the chin of the dragon with both hands.

"There, there, long time no see, Yoiyobi<sup><a href="#Prim1">1</a></sup>. Were you doing well?"

Ronye could not forget this name. It is the name of a legendary dragon who fought hard without rest against a red knights’ army during the Foreign World War. It was not a dark knight in front of her, but a Human World Integrity Knight. The rider, also known as a legendary "silent" knight ──

"...... perhaps, is this… Scheta-sama?"

When terrified Ronye asked this question turning her gaze to the rider’s hood, the rider answered removing it with both hands.

"Kirito...... Ronye. What are you doing in such a place?"

***

Scheta Synthesis Twelve.

Among current integrity knights, she was a senior knight following Fanatio and Dusolbert in the hierarchy, and her sword power was so strong that rumors lined her up with the former headmaster Bercouli Synthesis One.

They said there is nothing that cannot be cut by her sacred treasure "Black Lily Sword" given by the Highest Priest, and in a Foreign World War, first she countered the main force of fist fighters, and then bravely<sup><a href="#Prim2">2</a></sup> fought a fierce battle against the large army of red knights.

However, by the end of the battle, she left Central Cathedral and stayed at Obsidia castle as a full authority representative for the Human World Union Council.

In other words, she was the best person for Kirito and Ronnie to contact first — but, the question, how did Kirito bring her here, remained unanswered. Kirito swung the blade of mind against the castle, and Scheta was the single person who noticed it and flew to them — it seems to be only a result of a lucky coincidence that this haphazard strategy happened to be successful.

Holding back the desire to question Kirito, Ronye kept watching the interaction between the two of them.

"Sorry for bad surprise, Scheta-san. But I only came up with this way of calling you......."

When Kirito who also removed the hood scruplingly apologized, Scheta nodded with a bitter smile on a cool beautiful face.

"Be sure, I was surprised, when I realized that someone had delivered a blade of mind from the other side of the river, I thought that commander Bercouli had resurrected."

The way she spoke was simple and straightforward as before, but it seems that there were a lot of words and notes in her speech that softened a little since before.

"……but, why in that same room where I was?"

To Scheta question, Kirito shrugged his shoulders.

"Because from there I felt the most… uneasy feeling."

She repeated the same gesture with a slightly unsatisfied face.

"......I thought I was stopped to sweat, but my training is still noticeable from such a long distance."

By that conversation, Ronye finally realized that Kirito was not releasing a blade of mind by a lucky chance. With the gesture of spreading five fingers of the right hand that preceded it, he searched for the presence of Scheta. For Ronye it was a mystery that could not be reached at all, but ──

"Oh, senpai. Even though you own such amazing skills, all you could come up with is to imitate a child throwing a pebble in a friend's room window......"

She released these words unintentionally, then turned to laugh at Kirito who also turned to her.

"Well, did Ronye experience such a call from a boy?"

"I, I did not say it's my story!"

"Well, so then maybe it was you calling him......."

"It’s, it is not about me at all!"

Ronye who desperately denied it, saw a small smile appearing on Scheta’s pale face.

"It might have been a long and hard trip, Ronye. You better take a break at the castle."

She signaled with her right hand, and Yoiyobi laid down. There was no saddle, but thanks to that, all three of them could get on packed together. With Ronye in front, Kirito behind, and Scheta in the middle they rode the dragon which easily took off after running a bit on the riverbank, not frightened at all by the weight of the two of sacred treasure class long swords and three human beings.

Powerfully flapping wings, it quickly raised, aiming at the upper part of Obsidia castle. The guards noticed them, but it was known that it was a dragon of full authority ambassador, so there was no appearance of a fuss.

Yoiyobi flew to the mentioned terrace in about two minutes, and when three people descended, it sang them good-bye<sup><a href="#Prim3">3</a></sup> and flew back to the departure point again. When the dragon's large body disappeared, Ronye walked over to obsidian handrails and looked at the place where Kirito hit it with the blade of mind. As she had feared, scratches that are likely to be more than a centimeter deep were engraved clearly.

_They will certainly be angry, this is no..._ then Ronye raised her eyes towards the view in front of her and unexpectedly shouted completely forgetting what she was worrying about one second ago.

"Wow...... it’s amazing......!"

She could see the entire city of Obsidia in front of her eyes. It was a cluttered and disorganized townscape, completely different from the Centoria city separated radially in four equal fragments, but what she saw almost shined with the power of life.

"Hey that area of the city, where it seems the ground itself is stacked in numerous layers...a-ah, is that a stadium? It is big, senpai!"

Astonished Ronye heard Scheta's voice from behind.

"I know plenty of other places to see, so I'd like to suggest a sightseeing if there is time......."

Having removed her eyes from Ronye and turned around, Scheta pointed her sharp gaze towards Kirito.

"It feels like you came incognito, right? Had something happen in Centoria?"

"That's right."

Nodding, Kirito straightened the spine.

"I'd like to ask an urgent consultation with both Scheta and Dark Army commander Isukan."

***

The room behind the terrace was full of soft colors, too bright for the Dark Territory. Walls and ceiling were painted light pink, curtains were pale yellow, carpet had the color of young grass. It was not wood but ore that burnt red in a big fireplace heating the room so much that one would sweat wearing a coat.

_If this is the Scheta's private room, it is a bit of a surprising that she has such taste......_ thought Ronye, but immediately realized that the room was existing not for her.

There was a small bed about 1 mel long on the other side of the fireplace, and as Scheta walked up there, her profile was brightener by a gently emerged smile.

Scheta silently beckoned Ronye and Kirito standing still at the entrance. They approached, tiptoeing, and looked into the bed, where a baby wrapped in a white cloth was fast asleep.

It was about three months after birth, dark red hair looked soft like fluff, nose, mouth and both hands gently held on both sides of the head are incredibly small.

_I have heard rumors, then this baby is a child of Integrity Knight Scheta and fist fighter Isukan. That would have certainly been a girl……_ thinking this way, Ronye was asked the mother in a very, very quiet whispering.

"... What is her name?"

"Lisetta."

Scheta replied quietly and proudly added, throwing a short gaze at Kirito.

"We took the first sound from a green swordsman Leafa."

"Was it so? ...I did not know."

Murmured Kirito smiling while looking at the sleeping baby.

What broke the gentle silence that lasted for about 20 seconds was the sound of the door on the corridor side opening and in addition a soft voice slowly singing:

"Lisa-chan, it's time for milk<sup><a href="#Prim4">4</a></sup>..."

Who entered the room was a young man holding a tray with both hands. A simple silvery headband ran around burning-red curly short hair; although it was winter, his upper body was covered only with a thin hemp shirt. Underneath short trousers he wore sandals, strong muscles and countless scars ran through exposed shoulders and arms, his right eye was missing as if it was taken out; his look overall showed that he is a mighty warrior.

But on the other hand, a happy loose smile floated on his young face, very much as one of Kirito when he eats a honey pie; Ronye opened her mouth quietly to such a vision.

Immediately afterwards, the man with one eye also noticed Ronye and Kirito standing near the bed and the smile gradually left his face. His thick eyebrows faintly knited, and the line of sight began to jump back and forth between Scheta and two others.

Before the man tried to say something, Kirito raised his right hand and greeted him.

"Hi there Isukan, it’s been a while!"

Then, the commander of the Dark Army and fist fighter group leader Isukan opened the left eye so wide it almost jumped out.

"Thee.. ees is, Ki-ki-kirito? What happened to the color of your face…. No, rather, what are you doing in this place? The next meeting had been scheduled in March!"

"Well, I have a slightly urgent business. Sorry for intruding."

"Yeah, it's okay, but... no, wait, wait a moment."

A deep valley engraved between frowned eyebrows of Isukan. Scheta moved softly and took away the tray from her husband's hands.

Not reacting to this, fist fighter lowered his gloomy head.

"Kirito, okay, have you heard anything a little while ago...?"

"A little while ago....... Ah, yeah, the milk thing... Heh... Well, Isukan is totally daddy now, ha-ha-ha!"

"Ha-ha-ha... well, if you heard that, you cannot return home unharmed. With this blow, I will punch off your memories from your head!"

Shouted Isukan clenching his right hand. A light like a semi-transparent red flame wrapped his powerful fist.

"Wha…, se-se-se-senpai......!"

![Image](/Translate/Img/p194.jpg)

Kirito moved Ronye, who didn’t know what to do as an escort in such a case, away with right hand. Standing in front of Isukan, he thrusted the left palm ahead.

"There, come on!"

"**U~ra-ra-ra…!!**"

Along with this shout, Isukan kicked off the floor. Drawing a burning red trace in the air, his fist was thrown out at a speed that could not be caught by Ronye's eyes, and hit Kirito’s palm.

Explosive blasting sound roared, the shock violently threw asides curtains and decorative cloth. It was obviously a blow of a terrible power, but Kirito standing firmly on the spot bent his upper body a bit, and handled the fist of Isukan with one palm.

The Fist Fighters’ Leader and the Human World Prime Swordsman kept quiet for a while keeping the right hand and the left palm in contact, when Isukan soon lifted his face and laughed.

"It looks to me, you’re getting weaker, Kirito."

"In your dreams, Isukan."

Besides two smiling men, who shook her head in amazement was Scheta, still holding a tray. Ronye approached the bed and looked into it to check if the baby woke up, but Lisetta, the child of the strongest knight and the strongest fist fighter, kept happily sleeping without noticing the big fuss.

***

Isukan pushed out the guards who ran inside through the door after hearing the roar and blocked it with two legs from a chair, then lined up some other chairs by the window.

Of course, the guards were doubtful of Kirito and Ronye, but either due to the "Law of the Strongest" or maybe because of Isukan’s authority, they were convinced by the commander's comment "Worry not, I’ll explain later".

As the guards had gone away the nine o'clock bells rang and the baby woke up as if it was a signal for getting up, and began to cry. Scheta lifted her up from the bed and they sat together on one of the chairs; the child began to drink milk from a baby bottle made of fibo fruit, same as in Human World.

As the fibo fruit is ripened, it becomes semi-transparent and hollow like a glass bottle, and because of its elasticity and water impenetrability as well as the part of the lid protruding like a nipple, the plant was said to be created by the goddess of the earth Terraria specially for babies.

_But as long as we know about the existence of real world, it is probably ─ the real world people actually created it rather than Terraria goddess ─_ one couldn’t help thinking this way. Watching Lisetta purring “**n\~ku, n\~ku**”, Scheta raised the face and said.

"Will you try?"

"Is that ok?"

"Sure."

Ronye held the past baby with a left arm. She got the baby bottle with her right hand, brought it closer to the mouth.

Lisetta stared at Ronye for a moment with gray eyes very similar to her mother’s, but immediately began drinking milk again. In Cathedral she had given milk to Berchie as well several times, but because this was a girl, the feeling holding her was quite different.

"I wanted to raise her with breast feeding but it seems that there’s a secret formula milk within the fist fighters group."

Hearing words of Scheta, Isukan, who was exchanging reports on the recent status with Kirito sitting across the small table, looked at them and said:

"Well, if you drink that thing you will not catch a cold, your bones will become harder and grow stronger."

Used as well in Human World, a general-purpose sacred language ─ sacred words widely used by the public like "curtain" and "table"<sup><a href="#Prim5">5</a></sup> ─ word "milk" meant specifically cow milk or sheep milk warmed to the human body temperature with additions of various types of medically-effective ingredients used exclusively for babies as a replacement for breast feeding. What are those additions exactly — has been transmitted within families or areas from generation to generation, and in that sense, it can be named a "secret formula". As Scheta said, they often tell stories that breast milk is the best and it might be actually the truth, but without a bottle made of fibo fruit filled with “milk”, raising babies would be much more difficult to busy farmers and merchants.

Anyway, Lisetta herself seemed to have no dissatisfaction with milk containing secret fist fighter ingredient, and when she finished the bottle in a blink of an eye, she made a small burp. She became sleepy, so Ronye gave her back to Scheta who lied her down on the bed.

Scheta who came back soon had already an expression of a knight rather than a mother, and as soon as she got on the chair, she said.

"So, what happened?"

Kirito nodded and started talking about the murder case occurred in South Centoria two days ago.

Isukan and Scheta listened silently, but at the moment when the story ran over to the mountain goblin Oroi who was accused as the murderer, two people sharply breathed. But without saying a word, they finished listening to where Kirito and Ronye flew out of Human World with a "dragon" and arrived at Obsidia last night.

"……I see……. Spreading this would incur undesired attention....... "

To the commander sitting next to him, Prime Swordsman shook his head gently.

"No, I thought of sending a message as the first thing to do, but... the time for delivery and waiting for the reply to come back, it will be next month."

Currently, the communication between Centoria and Obsidia relies on a horse riding messengers passing through ten cities and fortresses. The number of days it takes one way is really two weeks. Moreover, there is a danger that a messenger will be attacked by numerous huge monsters inhabiting the Dark Territory.

"That's right……I wish I had found a parent skull....... "

Isukan sighed and Kirito nodded with a sad face, so Ronnie blinked and asked.

"Sorry, that parent skull ...what is it?"

"Oh, I learned about it when the war ended. There is a sacred treasure used by the emperor Vector to give orders to ten armies at the time of a Foreign World War. One big parent skull and ten smaller children skulls in one set; when you talk to parent skull, that voice would reach instantly to child skulls at a remote place."

She instinctively rounded eyes hearing the description from Kirito.

"Wait a moment...... There is such a thing so one won’t need a letter or horses?"

"They wouldn’t... Well, it's a one-way from parent to child, so you cannot talk with just one set."

"And in the first place, the parent skull and some child skulls have gone missing after the war, so it is a useless toy now."

Isukan sighed and added.

"The problem is that human being killed... It would be impossible......For everyone who are going on sightseeing in Human World, I have letters in writing saying that fighting and killing is prohibited by the name of Dark Territory tribe leaders and the commander of the Dark Territory himself. One by one, I have signed all of them... As long as there is a "the law of the strongest", only one person can ignore that order in the dark world."

The moment Ronye thought it was, of course, that Isukan himself, Scheta added:

"Two persons"

"............ only two persons"

Looking at Isukan frowning for being corrected, Kirito let a quick smile run across his face, but immediately returned to a perplexed expression.

"Yes, I think so too, in fact, the dagger that Oroi seemingly used to kill the cleaner from Human World have disappeared from the arsenal. Probably it was a "temporary weapon" produced from metallic element......It is not myself that noticed it, but Ronye, by the way. "

"Heh, you have a nice disciple, don’t you think so?"

"I… I’m not a disciple, I’m rather..."

As Kirito tilted his head looking at her, Ronye also seemed to be thinking of what she is now to Kirito, but quickly shook that out of her head, raised the hand and spoke.

"Well, I thought about that a bit more... but the weapon in question was reproducing the mountain goblin dagger fine enough for Oroi-san to mistake it for the real one for a moment. So, we guessed that the dark arts master was involved in the incident... but......."

She closed her mouth, looking at Scheta and Isukan in order, asking with courage.

"...... but before that, what the dark arts masters’ guild is doing now ...?"

The couple exchanged glances, and Isukan coughed and answered.

"I was going to report this properly at the next meeting......It’s a shame, but we are unable to grasp the current status of the dark arts masters’ guild. "

"What do you mean……?"

Kirito also raised eyebrows.

"D.I.L. who was the former guild master was slain by the Green Swordsman and died, after that the female arts master named K.U.V. succeeded. But even my eyes can see that she is not quite open to dark arts, she is indeed insufficient in strength."

Scheta confirmed the words of Isukan.

"Looking at her, my skill is better than hers."

"So, we investigated secretly, and K was at best tenth in the guild hierarchy when D was alive. In other words, the whole lot of top guys are quietly missing."

"...... the dark masters’ guild, in the battle by the "Great Eastern Gate", didn’t they lose nearly 2000 people killed? Weren’t those guys joining the troops?"

Isukan denied Kirito’s point, frowning.

"I do not think so....... Their obsession to survive is monstrous. Even D would be alive now should she not have fought with Green Swordsman. They are not so gentle people that nearly the whole top ten are killed in battle together."

Isukan returned the line of sight to Ronye and finished the explanation.

".......In consequence, the dark arts masters’ guild that is currently participating in the Five Clans Conference, perhaps, is just an empty shell. It’s possible that really skilled dark arts masters with real power have hidden somewhere in the cellars. And then there is also a possibility that they are involved in the incident that happened in Human World.... ── But you seem to disagree, Ronye? You do not think so, do you?"

"Well, you know, I’ve got no basis to deny it, but... I just thought it was strange. Even if the dark arts masters’ guild hides in the basement behind the curtain, isn’t it possible for them to get a real goblin dagger, so they do not have to bother generating a fancy weapon from the metallic element... "

"... It certainly is. Sure, for goblins, the dagger with the clan crest embellished should be an important symbol, but even so, they are casted massively by smiths. Would they need, they are able to quickly get one or two, either steal it, or buy it. "

Kirito nodded to Isukan’s muttering.

"If the goal of the real culprit was to raise the tension between Human World and Dark Territory by putting the guilt of murder on Oroi, it would be more effective to prepare a real dagger....... ── Something the real culprit could not do if it is someone within Human World......"

"This would bring us to an even bigger mystery."

Scheta pointed out sharply narrowing grey eyes.

"People of Human World are bound by far more rigid laws than those of Dark Territory. The murder is a violation of an explicit entry of Taboo Index, which means, if the one who killed the cleaner is a Human World person, that he can ignore the Taboo Index."

Simultaneously with Kirito saying that, Ronye silently nodded.

It was also pointed out in discussion with Fanatio immediately after the incident. Even Integrity Knights who are not bound by the Taboo Index cannot take away the whole life of an innocent civilian like a cleaner Yazen by any means.

Kirito shook his head slowly, muttering something regarding him still not understanding anything.

Isukan nodded quietly and thought for a while, but soon clapped his hands as if to change the atmosphere.

"── OK, anyway, I understand the situation. It’s a pity, it seems better to interrupt the tourism with Human World for a while... "

"Well...... at the moment we are preventing the spreading of this information within Centoria, but if the second and the third incidents happen, we won’t be able to control it even with the power of Union Council. Then we’ll temporarily block the Great Eastern Gate and tourists staying in Centoria will also be sent home as soon as possible."

Although his tone sounded already full of wholehearted regrets, Kirito continued with even more heavier voice.

"......and also, the mountain goblin Oroi who is currently secured in Central Cathedral... he cannot return soon. Maybe I’m still missing something, maybe there is a reason why he was caught. ── Oroi, he belongs to clan Uboli from the hill. I'm sorry, but..."

"All right, I will contact Uboli myself and explain the circumstances."

After nodding, Isukan glanced out of the window and turned back to Kirito again.

"── As for tourists going to Human World from here, this is fine... How about merchant parties coming from Human World? Certainly, every party should stay away from Obsidia."

"Ugh, and this also..."

Kirito groaned with his arms folded.

As a part of exchange project, in addition to the acceptance of tourists visiting Human World from Dark Territory, the dispatching of merchant parties from Human World has begun. Although it was still in trial scale, only including buying and selling goods via several horse-drawn carriages, but in Dark Territory there are lots of rare items not found in Human World like luminescent stone used for lighting, so great merchants who sniffed the smell of money were flooding officials with requests for dispatch permission.

"...... If the culprit of the incident is an organization, they may have companions in Obsidia, then the reverse of cleaner murder may happen...... In other words, there is indeed a possibility that a human merchant might try to kill a resident of Dark Territory. However, in the merchant parties there are skilled men from the Human World Army and clerics as escorts, additionally merchants are following regulations so they cannot dispatch without permission, so that wouldn’t be easy, I think..."

Scheta also nodded to the words of Kirito.

"I do not think there is a need to stop the trade business right now also because the merchant parties carry a lot of valuable medicine and media of the human world, so they are welcomed more than I had expected....... As a precaution, during merchants’ stay in Obsidia, one of my disciples will be attending them. "

"Eh, disciples......? Scheta-san wasn’t transferred with a company.... Hmm, I was under impression you have come here alone by yourself...? "

To Kirito who had a surprised expression on his face painted dark, Isukan answered in a voice that mixed pride and concern.

"That means, Scheta is now not only an ambassador but also a guest instructor for the dark knight team"

"What, a guest instructor...?"

"When I went to visit the Knights Order, a young captain dragged me into a game, you know, a borrowed sword ......And well, I succeeded with only sheath without its contents. Now I have my own dojo at the headquarters of the Order."

"There are only about ten disciples, but everyone is quite good."

"Yep, they are......"

Scheta added with a serious look towards Kirito who seemed to have no words.

"I would like you to come and join the dojo and practice with disciples."

"No, no, I have not practiced traditional swordsmanship for quite a while..."

The shoulder of Kirito retreating as far as the chair back allowed was gently patted with Isukan’s stretched left hand.

"Well, then come to the training hall of the fighting team after the knight team as well. There are quite a few people who doubt your strength, so please take this opportunity to force the “Law of the Strongest”."

"I do not care about it! I have civil ambitions!"

_Oh, this guy won’t let you to escape already......._thought Ronye watching the agitated Kirito.
