# Part 7

When she awoke to the heavy sound of a bell, the bright light was already falling through the thin window curtain.

After blinking several times, she scratched the eyes and set in the sofa. With the cloak wrapped instead of a blanket around the body, she looked around the room with drowsy eyes.

First thing she saw was the figure of a black-haired swordsman sleeping deeply in the bed in front of the sofa. Eight hours passed, and the effect of the ointment had gone out, so the sleeping face that regained whiteness was surprisingly inconvenient, and Ronye smiled a little.

Finally, she realized that she had stayed overnight in the same room with Kirito ─ even though, of course, the beds were separate ─ and all the drowsiness immediately faded away, the face got hot. She put her cold hands, which were out of the cloak, on her head and took a deep breath to somehow regain calmness, then got up vigorously.

Moved to the side of the bed, gently shook the shoulders of sleeping Kirito.

"Senpai, please get up, it's eight o'clock."

When Ronye heard it last night, she noticed that the melody of the bell was exactly the same as that of Central Cathedral’s ones.

_Why do the bells installed in the Human World Axiom Church and the bells of the Dark Territory capital far away from each other playing the same sound..?_ At the time of such thoughts, Kirito revealed ambiguous mumbling and tried to get in under the blanket.

"Ugh...... a bit more ............"

"Ah, sleeping is waste!"

In a hurry she tried to pull off the blanket, but Kirito did not let it go, firmly holding the edge with both hands like a child.

"Five minutes more...... No, let me sleep for just three minutes, Yujio..."

When she heard that name, Ronye inhaled a small breath. Pulling a hand away from the blanket, she walked one step away.

About two years have elapsed since Elite Swordsman-in-Training Yujio, who was a close friend of Kirito, lost his life in battle with the Highest Priest Administrator. For Kirito, however, the days spent with Yujio have not been left in the past. Just like for Tiese.

On her tiptoes, she returned to the sofa and sat again.

_Asuna, a Vice-Prime Swordsman who is waking up in the same room as Kirito, knows Kirito's heart... Does she know the existence of deep sorrow that he is hiding? And if she does, I wonder how does she keeps her gentle, kind smile standing by Kirito......._

She decided to talk to Asuna properly upon the return to Centoria. Of course, not about the feeling kept secretly in Ronye’s mind, but because both of them feel they want to be the power of Kirito.

While she was thinking about such things, surprisingly Kirito woke up in about three minutes as declared asleep, and looked the room around with both eyes closed more than half.

When noticing Ronye, he had a great yawn “**Fuwa~~**” and called out "Good morning Ronye".

"...... Yes, good morning, Kirito-senpai."

"Bad, I overslept... What time is it now?"

"The eight o'clock bell has just rung."

"Oh, so for checkou... ehm, it looks like we will be on time to leave the inn."

Once again, he gave a short yawn and then got up from the bed. Moved to the window and drew a gray curtain vigorously.

"Oh, Ronye, come here, you can see the castle."

"Really?"

As she moved away from the sofa and stood by the side of Kirito, to the slightly right side of the front of the window and beyond the cluttered cityscape, she could clearly see the big black castle towering up against the sky.

Its appearance piercing the morning glow of the Dark Territory, which was much redder than one of the Human World, although it is built from mostly natural rocks, was far more violent than Central Cathedral, which in reverse created a kind of beauty. Kirito, who should have been visiting for the second time, also exhaled a long breath as if admiring.

"... Unlike Central Cathedral built by Higher Priest Administrator’s sacred art, that castle was carved out of a rocky mountain with human hands."

Having heard the words of Kirito, Ronnie also sighed unwillingly.

"How many months... years did it take?"

"It took more than a hundred years. ── Now, let's leave soon. We don’t have time to rest till lunch."

"Hey, the one who overslept was senpai!"

Kirito began collecting his luggage when he replied to Ronye's point with a mischievous smile.
