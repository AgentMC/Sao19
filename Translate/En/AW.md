# Afterword

Thank you for reading Sword Art Online volume 19 "Moon Cradle".

This story is treated as a follow-up to an Alicization ark completed in volume 18, but since there are couple of times we have met word "later" throughout a story, let me explain them in the first place. (Please keep in mind that it’s a spoiler!)

In the middle of volume 18, Underworld has entered the "critical acceleration phase" where time flows about 5 million times faster than the speed of the real world. Kirito and Asuna were left behind at that time and logged out after spending two hundred years in the Underworld, but this "Moon Cradle" is a very early episode of that two hundred years span. In other words, in the volume 19, less than 5 days are passing, but in the real world it is only about one five-millionth of that, about 0,08 seconds.

Sorry that the story ended so quickly but it will continue at once! In the next volume we will return to the stage of Centoria again, and Kirito, Ronye and Asuna will confront the conspiracy masterpiece. I'd like to publish it as soon as possible, so please wait a bit.

A small supplement to contents.

During the story line, Ronye imagines the numbers her and Tiese will get becoming Integrity Knights, but there were also people who wondered “wasn’t the number 32 Yujio’s?” Indeed, the hand of the Administrator cleaned his memory and gave him the title of "Integrity Knight Yujio Synthesis Thirty-Two", but when he regained the memory after the fight with Kirito, he died in the battle against Administrator immediately after. As Kirito is the only human who knows the circumstances, at the time of "Moon Cradle", he did not tell anyone that Yujio has become an Integrity Knight. Therefore, number 32 shall not be skipped, and it is supposed to be taken over by someone.

I guess, we won’t reach this point in the next volume, but I’d love to write about how Ronye and Tiese become Integrity Knights someday.

On February 18th, 2017, about one week after the release of this book, the theatrical version of “Sword Art Online: Ordinal Scale” will finally be released. It is a totally different AR game compared to the past VRMMOs, but it is packed with amazing graphics, so be sure to take a look at it on a big screen of the theater by all means! And abec-san and Miki-san, I’m very sorry for all the disturbance I gave you this time! Thank you also for the next volume!!

A certain day in January 2017
